Ivory Coast	1516	1527	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ivory_Coast	Major cocoa exporters are likely to limit sales in the weeks ahead in an effort to boost world prices, sources close to a meeting of the Cocoa Producers Alliance (CPA) said. The sources said the depressed world market had been one of the main topics discussed in a closed door meeting of the 11-member CPA which began on Monday. They said producers agreed that cutting sales would aid the buffer stock manager of a new international cocoa pact in his effort to support prices. Major cocoa producing and consuming nations agreed operation rules for the buffer stock at a meeting in London last month and the stock manager is expected to enter the market soon. Prices, under the weight of three successive cocoa surpluses, recently fell to the level at which the manager has to buy cocoa under stock rules. The buffer stock aims to keep prices within a pre-set range by buying when prices fall and selling when they rise. The worlds cocoa price at present is just not interesting, commented one delegate representing a major CPA producer. Another source said that with much of the 1986/87 (October-September) world cocoa crop sold, limiting sales in the near term concerns essentially next years harvest. The sources noted, however, that the cocoa industry in Brazil, the worlds number two producer, is in private hands. This means limiting sales is more difficult than in major West African producers, where sales are made or authorized by commodity marketing boards. The CPA includes the worlds top three producers, Ivory Coast, Brazil and Ghana, and accounts for 80 pct of all output. The meeting here is due to end tomorrow evening.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Districts_of_Ivory_Coast	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Departments_of_Ivory_Coast	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Regions_of_Ivory_Coast	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Coast_Province	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Communes_of_Ivory_Coast	http://dbpedia.org/resource/United_States_Coast_Guard	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sub-prefectures_of_Ivory_Coast	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Atlantic_Coast_Conference	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Coast	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Gold_Coast,_Queensland	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ivory	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pacific_Coast_League	http://dbpedia.org/resource/British_Columbia_Coast	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Coast_Mountains	http://dbpedia.org/resource/West_Coast_Eagles	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Wizards_of_the_Coast	http://dbpedia.org/resource/West_Coast_hip_hop	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pacific_Coast_Conference	http://dbpedia.org/resource/West_Coast_of_the_United_States	http://dbpedia.org/resource/East_Coast_of_the_United_States
Franklin	1160	1168	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Franklin,_Tennessee	Promising new findings in the use of a controversial experimental drug called Interleukin-2 as a cure for cancer will be published in the April 9 issue of the prestigious New England Journal of Medicine, according to a Wall Street analyst who has obtained an advance copy of the magazine. Among interleukins principal U. S. makers are Cetus Corp CTUS, headquartered in Emeryville, Calif., and Immunex Corp IMNX, based in Seattle, Wash. The journal, to be released late today, contains two articles reporting high remission rates several cancer types. The journal also contains a signed editorial concluding that the new results mark a significant milestone in the search for a successful immunotherapy for cancer. Interleukin-2, also known as IL-2, is a substance naturally produced by living cells in the laboratory. The drug is controversial because it was widely praised as a promising cancer treatment in early reports on its effectiveness in late 1985, only to come under criticism a year later for its failure to live up to its promise and due to its ravaging side effects. One of the new studies, conducted by Dr. William West of Biotherapeutics Inc of Franklin, Tenn., is particularly significant because it found far fewer harsh side effects after it changed the way in which the drug is administered. In that study, researchers administered IL-2 to 48 cancer patients and found a 50-pct remission rate for kidney cancers and a 50 pct remission rate for melanoma, a type of skin cancer, according to Prudential-Bache Securities Stuart Weisbrod, who obtained the advance copy of the magazine. For rectal and colon cancer, the researchers found no remissions, but none of the 48 patients treated had side effects serious enough to be placed under intensive hospital care, according to the article. In the second study, whose principal author is Dr. Steven Rosenberg of the National Cancer Institute, researchers administered IL-2 to 157 cancer patients and found a 33 pct remission rate in cancers of the kidney, a 27 pct rate in melanomas and a 15 pct rate in cancers of the colon and rectum. In the National Cancer Institute trials, a total of four patients died, the magazine reported, confirming the harshness of the drugs side effects as originally administered. Perhaps we are at the end of the beginning of the search for successful immunotherapy for cancer, said the editorial, signed by John Durant of Philadelphias Chase Cancer Center. These observations reported by Rosenberg and West surely did not describe successful practical approaches ready for widespread applications in the therapy of cancer patients, the editorial said. On the other hand, if they reflect, as seems possible, a successful manipulation of the cellular immune system, then we may be near the end of our search for a meaningful direction in the immunuotherapy of cancer, the editorial concluded.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Franklin_D._Roosevelt	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Benjamin_Franklin	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Aretha_Franklin	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Franklin_Pierce	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Franklin_Institute	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Franklin_Field	http://dbpedia.org/resource/John_Franklin	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Franklin_County,_Pennsylvania	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Kirk_Franklin	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Paul_Franklin_(musician)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Franklin_County,_Ohio	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Franklin_County,_Missouri	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Franklin_County,_New_York	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Miles_Franklin_Award	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Franklin_&_Marshall_College	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Franklin_County,_Tennessee	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Division_of_Franklin_(state)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Franklin,_Indiana	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Franklin_W._Dixon	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Franklin_County,_North_Carolina
Chicago Mercantile Exchange	4	31	http://dbpedia.org/resource/CME_Group	The Chicago Mercantile Exchange, CME, said it has added a new chief compliance officer and will expand its regulatory surveillance program. Paul OKelly, currently assistant regional administrator of the Securities and Exchange Commission, was named vice-president of compliance for the exchange, the CME said. The expanded compliance program, which calls for an increase in the exchanges compliance budget and addition of staff, was in response to recent criticisms that the CMEs current surveillance was not able to keep up with increased demands of recent volatility and volume, the CME said. The new surveillance program calls for the addition of three floor investigators and five compliance investigators, the CME said. Some of the new staff will monitor the exchanges new Computerized Trade Reconstruction system, scheduled to start July 1. In addition, three computer programmers will be added to assist in regulatory support for the exchanges management information system department. Recent criticism has been especially directed at the CMEs Standard and Poors stock index futures and options division. A special membership referendum to prohibit CME members from filling customer orders and trading for their own account in S and P 500 futures and options will be voted on April 13. In a letter dated March 12, CME chairman John Sandner and Executive committee chairman Leo Melamed urged members to reject the referendum in favor a series of new rules. Included in the rule changes was the requirement that futures brokers in the S and P pit manually record all personal trades to the nearest minute, intended to enhance the effectiveness of surveillance and compliance functions, We made a promise to our members that we have kept, Melamed said in a release today. He said the new surveillance program represents a commitment to a vigorous enforcement policy.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/London_Stock_Exchange_Group	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Japan_Exchange_Group	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Chicago_Surrealist_Group	http://dbpedia.org/resource/CEE_Stock_Exchange_Group	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Chicago_Public_Art_Group	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Chicago_Research_and_Trading_Group	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ethnic_groups_in_Chicago	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Barber_v_Guardian_Royal_Exchange_Assurance_Group	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Section_8_Chicago	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Exchange_Place,_New_Orleans	http://dbpedia.org/resource/1926_Chicago_Maroons_football_team	http://dbpedia.org/resource/1933_Chicago_Cardinals_season	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Irish_Stock_Exchange	http://dbpedia.org/resource/The_Chicago_Theme	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Securities_and_Exchange_Commission_(Philippines)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Metro_Chicago	http://dbpedia.org/resource/We_Believe:_Chicago_and_Its_Cubs	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Chicago_Area_Waterway_System	http://dbpedia.org/resource/The_Earl_of_Chicago	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Norwood_Park,_Chicago

Carter	401	407	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Jimmy_Carter	A Treasury official said there are no plans to try to reduce the U.S. budget deficit by issuing yen-denominated bonds that would become known as Reagan bonds. It simply isnt something that we are planning to do, the official said. He added the Treasury was aware of Japanese news reports suggesting the Reagan administration might issue such bonds as the former Carter administration did when it sold Carter bonds denominated in West German marks. But he said the situation was greatly different now. If you look at the differences between the treasury market now and in the Carter administration years, it is a much more global market now, the official said. There was not the same ease then for the holder of another currency to buy other countries securities, he added, But there is no difficulty now for them to purchase dollars and buy U.S. securities. The United States needs dollars, not Japanese yen, to pay its debts and reduce the deficit and so has no plans to issue yen-denominated bonds, he emphasized.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ron_Carter	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Benny_Carter	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Lin_Carter	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Elliott_Carter	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Carter_Family	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Angela_Carter	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Aaron_Carter	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Carter_Center	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Helena_Bonham_Carter	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Betty_Carter	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Amon_G._Carter_Stadium	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Howard_Carter	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Carter_Glass	http://dbpedia.org/resource/June_Carter_Cash	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Rosalynn_Carter	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Chris_Carter_(screenwriter)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Carter_Burwell	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Lynda_Carter	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Carter_County,_Oklahoma	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Deana_Carter

Burlington	805	815	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Burlington_Industries	The largest U.S. textile maker focused on its own business as its competitors found merger partners, but now Burlington Industries Inc may have restructured itself into an attractive takeover candidate, analysts said. The takeover spotlight fell today on Burlington, which rose 4-7/8 to 52-7/8 on speculation that investor Asher Edelman and Dominion Textiles Inc of Canada bought an almost five pct stake. A published report said Edelman and Dominion jointly acquired a stake in Burlington and were weighing a takeover offer. Edelman would not comment, and a spokesman for Montreal-based Dominion called the report just rumors. Burlington said it did not know if the report was true. Wall Street professionals said they were not convinced of the story or that Edelman and Dominion would be the victors if Burlington actually came into play. Arbitragers said past comments from Dominion, however, added credence to the speculation. Dominion has said that it was looking for a takeover in the U.S. Last year, Dominion unsuccessfully bid for Avondale Mills and has maintained a 120 mln dlr line of credit to be used for a U.S. acquisition. A Dominion spokesman said Canadas largest textile producer has been negotiating with many U.S. textile companies, but would not say whether Burlington was among them. There have been acquisitions in this area. Its not unusual that someone could be looking at Burlington after the housecleaning theyve done, said Eileen Gormley of Thomson McKinnon. Burlington sold its domestic operations, which made sheets and other linens, to J.P. Stevens and Co Inc for 110 mln dlrs last year. It also has reorganized management, and focused its operations on businesses that would be less affected by foreign competition, Gormley said. Theyve pulled back so as not to be a commodity marketer, said Gormley. She said in moving more heavily into industrial fabrics, Burlington bought C.H. Masland, which supplies carpets and other fabric to the auto industry. In the past, they just spent and never realized the return on the outlays they did make, she said. You look at their record over the year, and I think theyre poised to be more profitable than they had been in the past, Gormley said. She estimated 1987 earnings of 2.50 dlrs per share, up from 2.01 dlrs per share. Some analysts today recommended clients not buy Burlington at its current levels. Edward Johnson of Johnson Redbook said he recommends selling. He said he believes the stock is worth only about 50 dlrs on a takeover basis and about 46 dlrs on an earnings basis. Some arbitragers, however, said takeover values have been placed on the company of 60 to 65 dlrs per share. After Ashers (Edelman) recent history, a lot of people dont find him very credible anymore, said one arbitrager. Another, however, said Edelman succeeds in forcing managements to take steps to enhance shareholder values even if he doesnt win the target company. Edelman was unsuccessful last year in offers for Lucky Stores Inc and Fruehauf Corp. He did succeed in buying Ponderosa Inc. The stocks of other textile makers rose along with Burlington. J.P. Stevens STN climbed 5/8 to 44-7/8, and Fieldcrest Cannon Inc FLD, the result of a merger of Fieldcrest and Cannon, rose 1-1/8 to 39-3/4. West Point-Pepperell Inc WPM rose 1-7/8 to 67-1/8.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Burlington,_Vermont	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Burlington,_Ontario	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Burlington,_Iowa	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Burlington_County,_New_Jersey	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Burlington,_North_Carolina	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Chicago,_Burlington_and_Quincy_Railroad	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Burlington_Northern_Railroad	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Burlington,_New_Jersey	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Burlington,_Massachusetts	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Burlington,_Wisconsin	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Burlington_Coat_Factory	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Burlington_House	http://dbpedia.org/resource/The_Burlington_Magazine	http://dbpedia.org/resource/South_Burlington,_Vermont	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Burlington,_Colorado	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Burlington_Bees	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Burlington_Arcade	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Burlington,_Connecticut	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Burlington,_Kentucky	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Burlington,_Washington

Duponts Conoco Incs	4374	4393	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Conoco	Cheap oil feedstocks, the weakened U.S. dollar and a plant utilization rate approaching 90 pct will propel the streamlined U.S. petrochemical industry to record profits this year, with growth expected through at least 1990, major company executives predicted. This bullish outlook for chemical manufacturing and an industrywide move to shed unrelated businesses has prompted GAF Corp (GAF), privately-held Cain Chemical Inc, and other firms to aggressively seek acquisitions of petrochemical plants. Oil companies such as Ashland Oil Inc (ASH), the Kentucky-based oil refiner and marketer, are also shopping for money-making petrochemical businesses to buy. I see us poised at the threshold of a golden period, said Paul Oreffice, chairman of giant Dow Chemical Co (DOW), adding, Theres no major plant capacity being added around the world now. The whole game is bringing out new products and improving the old ones. Analysts say the chemical industrys biggest customers, automobile manufacturers and home builders that use a lot of paints and plastics, are expected to buy quantities this year. U.S. petrochemical plants are currently operating at about 90 pct capacity, reflecting tighter supply that could hike product prices by 30 to 40 pct this year, said John Dosher, managing director of Pace Consultants Inc of Houston. Demand for some products such as styrene could push profit margins up by as much as 300 pct, he said. Oreffice, speaking at a meeting of chemical engineers in Houston, said Dow would easily top the 741 mln dlrs it earned last year and predicted it would have the best year in its history. In 1985, when oil prices were still above 25 dlrs a barrel and chemical exports were adversely affected by the strong U.S. dollar, Dow had profits of 58 mln dlrs. I believe the entire chemical industry is headed for a record year or close to it, Oreffice said. GAF chairman Samuel Heyman estimated that the U.S. chemical industry would report a 20 pct gain in profits during 1987. Last year, the domestic industry earned a total of 13 billion dlrs, a 54 pct leap from 1985. The turn in the fortunes of the once-sickly chemical industry has been brought about by a combination of luck and planning, said Paces John Dosher. Dosher said last years fall in oil prices made feedstocks dramatically cheaper and at the same time the American dollar was weakening against foreign currencies. That helped boost U.S. chemical exports. Also helping to bring supply and demand into balance has been the gradual market absorption of the extra chemical manufacturing capacity created by Middle Eastern oil producers in the early 1980s. Finally, virtually all major U.S. chemical manufacturers have embarked on an extensive corporate restructuring program to mothball inefficient plants, trim the payroll and eliminate unrelated businesses. The restructuring touched off a flurry of friendly and hostile takeover attempts. GAF, which made an unsuccessful attempt in 1985 to acquire Union Carbide Corp UK, recently offered three billion dlrs for Borg Warner Corp BOR, a Chicago manufacturer of plastics and chemicals. Another industry powerhouse, W.R. Grace (GRA) has divested its retailing, restaurant and fertilizer businesses to raise cash for chemical acquisitions. But some experts worry that the chemical industry may be headed for trouble if companies continue turning their back on the manufacturing of staple petrochemical commodities, such as ethylene, in favor of more profitable specialty chemicals that are custom-designed for a small group of buyers. Companies like DuPont (DD) and Monsanto Co MTC spent the past two or three years trying to get out of the commodity chemical business in reaction to how badly the market had deteriorated, Dosher said. But I think they will eventually kill the margins on the profitable chemicals in the niche market. Some top chemical executives share the concern. The challenge for our industry is to keep from getting carried away and repeating past mistakes, GAFs Heyman cautioned. The shift from commodity chemicals may be ill-advised. Specialty businesses do not stay special long. Houston-based Cain Chemical, created this month by the Sterling investment banking group, believes it can generate 700 mln dlrs in annual sales by bucking the industry trend. Chairman Gordon Cain, who previously led a leveraged buyout of Duponts Conoco Incs chemical business, has spent 1.1 billion dlrs since January to buy seven petrochemical plants along the Texas Gulf Coast. The plants produce only basic commodity petrochemicals that are the building blocks of specialty products. This kind of commodity chemical business will never be a glamorous, high-margin business, Cain said, adding that demand is expected to grow by about three pct annually. Garo Armen, an analyst with Dean Witter Reynolds, said chemical makers have also benefitted by increasing demand for plastics as prices become more competitive with aluminum, wood and steel products. Armen estimated the upturn in the chemical business could last as long as four or five years, provided the U.S. economy continues its modest rate of growth.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Conoco-Phillips_Building	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Jackson_Conoco_Service_Station	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Magnan_v._Anaconda_Industries,_Inc.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cafection_Enterprises_Inc.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hunger_Task_Force,_Inc.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Independent_Natural_Resources,_Inc	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Kingdomware_Technologies,_Inc._v._United_States	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mochila_Inc.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mimeo,_Inc	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Board_of_Certification,_Inc.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/After_the_War_(Mono_Inc._album)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Systematics,_Inc	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Entergy_Corp._v._Riverkeeper_Inc.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/American_Radio_Relay_League,_Inc._v._FCC	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Henningsen_v._Bloomfield_Motors,_Inc.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Oxbridge_Academy_Foundation,_Inc.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Photronics_Inc	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Nady_Systems,_Inc.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sheridan_Flouring_Mills,_Inc.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Jeremy_P._Tarcher_Inc.

Saouma	549	555	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Edouard_Saouma	World output of staple foods maintained growth in 1986, following a record harvest the year before, and most of the increase was in developing countries, the director general of the U.N.s Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) said. Speaking to FAOs committee on world food security, Edouard Saouma said sub-Saharan Africa registered a cereal production increase of 3.6 pct in 1986 and the Far East also continued to increase production. Despite ample supplies worldwide, many countries face problems in paying for all the food they need, he said. Saouma said many of the developing worlds food problems were the result of chaotic world trade. He said it was vital to promote employment to improve the food-security situation of the poor, with policy reforms in developing countries to remove existing disincentives to production so that agriculture could play a greater role in stimulating economic growth.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Splendid_woodpecker	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Superman_and_Batman:_World's_Funnest	http://dbpedia.org/resource/George_Garland	http://dbpedia.org/resource/1970–71_Blackpool_F.C._season	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Edit_Makedonska	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Chris_Duhon	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dirty_Weaponry	http://dbpedia.org/resource/The_Nek_Commonwealth_War_Graves_Commission_Cemetery	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Loveland_High_School_(Ohio)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Savignac-de-Miremont	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Polsat_JimJam	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bolohan	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Piątek,_Łódź_Voivodeship	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Matt_Erickson	http://dbpedia.org/resource/TEMP3ST	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Parwinder_Singh	http://dbpedia.org/resource/The_Country_of_the_Knife	http://dbpedia.org/resource/The_Little_Girl	http://dbpedia.org/resource/The_Highwayman_(TV_series)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Prenzlauer_Allee
U.K	795	798	http://dbpedia.org/resource/United_Kingdom	Britain intends to negotiate further agreements on international securities regulation to match those now in force with the U.S. And Japan, government sources said. The Department of Trade and Industry said earlier it had concluded a memorandum of understanding with Japans Finance Ministry to swap supervisory and investigatory information. The agreement covers stocks, shares and government bonds, but not commodity futures, whose regulation in Japan does not come under the Finance Ministry. It therefore does not cover some transactions on the London International Financial Futures Exchange and the London commodities and metal exchanges. The DTI said it hoped to seek further understandings with other countries which met in the U.K. Last December. The meeting involved delegates from the U.K., Switzerland, the U.S., Canada, Australia, Hong Kong, Japan, France, West Germany and Holland. Government sources said the deal with Japan completes arrangements linking Tokyo, the U.S. And London.

Iran	554	558	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Iran	Iran decided to continue its operations east of Basra to destroy Iraqs forces, Iranian Prime Minister Mir-Hossein Mousavi told Tehran Radio. That seems to be the best spot for the complete destruction of (Iraqi President) Saddams forces. This is why it was decided that the operations would forcefully continue there, he said. At the same time, we have maintained our ability to act throughout the length of the fronts, Mousavi told the radio, monitored by the British Broadcasting Corporation. Tehran Radio reported over 1,500 Iraqi casualties today as Iran continued its Karbala-8 operation launched early yesterday. Iran said over 2,600 Iraqis had been killed or wounded yesterday. Iraq said today its forces had beaten back the latest attacks inflicting heavy casualties. Mousavi told Tehran radio that on the whole, our advances have broken the back of the military forces of Saddam. Earlier today the Iranian news agency IRNA said Tehrans forces were stabilising new positions after their assault on Iraqi lines defending Basra, Iraqs second city. In Baghdad, a military spokesman said Iraqi warplanes today destroyed an oil pumping station and a production unit at Irans Ahvaz field.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Provinces_of_Iran	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Counties_of_Iran	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Iran_Standard_Time	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Iran–Iraq_War	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Iran_national_football_team	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Arak,_Iran	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Azerbaijan_(Iran)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cinema_of_Iran	http://dbpedia.org/resource/President_of_Iran	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Rey,_Iran	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Iran_hostage_crisis	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Zanjan,_Iran	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sari,_Iran	http://dbpedia.org/resource/2013–14_Iran_Pro_League	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Prime_Minister_of_Iran	http://dbpedia.org/resource/History_of_Iran	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sarband_District_(Iran)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Supreme_Leader_of_Iran	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Music_of_Iran	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Greater_Iran

U.S	981	984	http://dbpedia.org/resource/United_States	Britain intends to negotiate further agreements on international securities regulation to match those now in force with the U.S. And Japan, government sources said. The Department of Trade and Industry said earlier it had concluded a memorandum of understanding with Japans Finance Ministry to swap supervisory and investigatory information. The agreement covers stocks, shares and government bonds, but not commodity futures, whose regulation in Japan does not come under the Finance Ministry. It therefore does not cover some transactions on the London International Financial Futures Exchange and the London commodities and metal exchanges. The DTI said it hoped to seek further understandings with other countries which met in the U.K. Last December. The meeting involved delegates from the U.K., Switzerland, the U.S., Canada, Australia, Hong Kong, Japan, France, West Germany and Holland. Government sources said the deal with Japan completes arrangements linking Tokyo, the U.S. And London. A U.K. Agreement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) was signed last September. Todays agreement will deal with requests for information on a case by case basis, U.K. Government sources said.

Dominion Textile	435	451	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dominion_Textile	Dominion Textile Inc considers a published report that it has bought a stake in Burlington Industries Inc and is considering making a joint bid for the company to be a rumor, a company spokesman said. As far as I am concerned and the company is concerned, they are rumors and were not commenting on rumors, spokesman Michel Dufour told Reuters in response to a query. All the information that has been given out publicly is that, yes, Dominion Textile is interested in making an acquisition that big...probably based on that people are starting all sorts of rumors, he said. Dufour said yes when asked whether the report was only a rumor, but said the company was not prepared to comment further. Dominion Textile president and chairman Thomas Bell was out of town and unavailable for comment. Dominion Textile last year made an unsuccesful 104-mln- U.S.-dlr bid for Avondale Mills and has maintained a 120-mln- U.S.-dlr line of credit to be used for an American acquisition. Dufour said the company has been negotiating with many U.S. textile companies but would not say whether Burlington Industries was one of them. Burlingtons stock rose sharply this morning on the report, which said Dominion Textile had joined with U.S. investor Asher Edelman to buy a stake in the company and to consider making a takeover offer. Dominion Textile, which reported operating profit of 11.1 mln Canadian dlrs last year on sales of 926.5 mln dlrs, has repeatedly said it will concentrate on expanding into the U.S. The company has said it plans to diversify into new product and market areas in addition to expanding its textile operations.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Textile	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dominion	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dominion_of_Newfoundland	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Textile_manufacturing	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Old_Dominion_University	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Textile_industry	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Spinning_(textiles)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Spindle_(textiles)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Kings_Dominion	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dominion_of_Ceylon	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dominion_of_Pakistan	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Textile_Bowl	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dominion_of_India	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Textile_arts	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dominion_Lands_Act	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Toronto-Dominion_Bank	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Textile_printing	http://dbpedia.org/resource/The_Dominion_Post_(Wellington)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Stitch_(textile_arts)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dominion_Range

Pennzoil Co	463	474	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pennzoil	First Boston Corp analyst William Randol recommended the purchase of Texaco Inc today, saying the discount that investors have made in the share price to reflect the ongoing litigation with Pennzoil has been overdone relative to how we expect the case to conclude. Texacos stock rose 1/8 to 34-1/8. On Monday, the stock tumbled four points after the Supreme Court overturned a lower court decision that cut Texacos bond in the 10.3 billion dlr legal dispute with Pennzoil Co PZL to one billion dlrs. Yesterday, a Texas court granted a temporary injunction on the bond issue pending a hearing next week. The current litigation arose from Texacos buyout of Getty Oil Co in 1984. Pennzoil sued, arguing its earlier agreement to buy Getty was binding. Two Texas state courts upheld Pennzoils position. Randol, noting that the stock has suffered a great deal in the two years since the litigation was filed, said we recognize the legal problems but think investors have overdone it. He said the stock is selling at 48 pct of its asset value, and we think it represents a good value at this level.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pennzoil_Place	http://dbpedia.org/resource/2000_Pennzoil_400	http://dbpedia.org/resource/1997_Pennzoil_200	http://dbpedia.org/resource/2001_Pennzoil_Freedom_400	http://dbpedia.org/resource/1999_Pennzoil_400	http://dbpedia.org/resource/2013_Shell-Pennzoil_Grand_Prix_of_Houston	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Wolf_v_Forfar_Potato_Co	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Couric_&_Co.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Joint_Defence_and_Economic_Co-operation_Treaty	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Williams_v._Walker-Thomas_Furniture_Co.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Gornitzky_&_Co.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Edmonson_v._Leesville_Concrete_Co.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sibbach_v._Wilson_&_Co.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Merck_Finck_&_Co.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thomas_Salt_and_Co	http://dbpedia.org/resource/M.H._Alshaya_Co.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/List_of_Presidents_of_Co-operative_Congress	http://dbpedia.org/resource/List_of_Italian_football_transfers_summer_2014_(co-ownership)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Karl_&_Co	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Litster_v_Forth_Dry_Dock_and_Engineering_Co_Ltd
Asher Edelman	1236	1249	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Asher_Edelman	Dominion Textile Inc considers a published report that it has bought a stake in Burlington Industries Inc and is considering making a joint bid for the company to be a rumor, a company spokesman said. As far as I am concerned and the company is concerned, they are rumors and were not commenting on rumors, spokesman Michel Dufour told Reuters in response to a query. All the information that has been given out publicly is that, yes, Dominion Textile is interested in making an acquisition that big...probably based on that people are starting all sorts of rumors, he said. Dufour said yes when asked whether the report was only a rumor, but said the company was not prepared to comment further. Dominion Textile president and chairman Thomas Bell was out of town and unavailable for comment. Dominion Textile last year made an unsuccesful 104-mln- U.S.-dlr bid for Avondale Mills and has maintained a 120-mln- U.S.-dlr line of credit to be used for an American acquisition. Dufour said the company has been negotiating with many U.S. textile companies but would not say whether Burlington Industries was one of them. Burlingtons stock rose sharply this morning on the report, which said Dominion Textile had joined with U.S. investor Asher Edelman to buy a stake in the company and to consider making a takeover offer. Dominion Textile, which reported operating profit of 11.1 mln Canadian dlrs last year on sales of 926.5 mln dlrs, has repeatedly said it will concentrate on expanding into the U.S. The company has said it plans to diversify into new product and market areas in addition to expanding its textile operations.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Asher_Benjamin	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Asher	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Peter_Asher	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Irving_Asher	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Randy_Edelman	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Jane_Asher	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Asher_Roth	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tony_Asher	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Neal_Asher	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Edelman_(firm)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/William_Asher	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Gerald_Edelman	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Asher_Keddie	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Asher_ben_Jehiel	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tribe_of_Asher	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Marek_Edelman	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Jack_Asher	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Herb_Edelman	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Marian_Wright_Edelman	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mateh_Asher_Regional_Council

International Monetary Fund	434	461	http://dbpedia.org/resource/International_Monetary_Fund	The Zambian government has no immediate plans to follow last weeks increase in the producer price of maize with a hike in the retail price of maize meal, an official of the ruling party said. Last December, a 120 pct increase in the consumer price for refined maize meal, a Zambian staple, led to food riots in which at least 15 people died. That price increase, which President Kenneth Kaunda later revoked, followed pressure by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to reduce the governments subsidy bill. However, if the producer price rise, from 6.10 dlrs to 8.67 dlrs per 90-kg bag, is not accompanied by a retail price increase, the government will have to spend more on subsidies, a practice discouraged by the IMF. There is no way out but to raise the subsidy levels of meal. It (the government) would have to choose between the demands of the IMF and those of the people, a Ministry of Agriculture economist said.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/One_Day_International	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Amnesty_International	http://dbpedia.org/resource/International	http://dbpedia.org/resource/International_Baccalaureate	http://dbpedia.org/resource/International_relations	http://dbpedia.org/resource/International_Astronomical_Union	http://dbpedia.org/resource/BirdLife_International	http://dbpedia.org/resource/International_Olympic_Committee	http://dbpedia.org/resource/International_law	http://dbpedia.org/resource/International_League	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Twenty20_International	http://dbpedia.org/resource/International_Organization_for_Standardization	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Rotary_International	http://dbpedia.org/resource/International_Labour_Organization	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Flight_International	http://dbpedia.org/resource/International_Space_Station	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hedge_fund	http://dbpedia.org/resource/International_school	http://dbpedia.org/resource/International_Cricket_Council	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Toronto_International_Film_Festival

At the same time, we have maintained our ability to act throughout the length of the fronts, Mousavi told the radio, monitored by the British Broadcasting Corporation. Tehran Radio reported over 1,500 Iraqi casualties today as Iran continued its Karbala-8 operation launched early yesterday. Iran said over 2,600 Iraqis had been killed or wounded yesterday. Iraq said today its forces had beaten back the latest attacks inflicting heavy casualties. Mousavi told Tehran radio that on the whole, our advances have broken the back of the military forces of Saddam. Earlier today the Iranian news agency IRNA said Tehrans forces were stabilising new positions after their assault on Iraqi lines defending Basra, Iraqs second city.

Officials seen arriving by Reuter correspondents included West German Finance Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg and Bundesbank President Karl Otto Poehl, French Finance Minister Edouard Balladur and his central banker Jacques de Larosiere. Also seen arriving were Japanese Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa and Japans central bank governor Satoshi Sumita and British Chancellor of the Exchequer and central bank governor Robin Leigh Pemberton. There was no immediate sign of Italian or Canadian officials. Monetary sources have said a fully blown meeting of the Group of Seven is expected to begin around 3 p.m. local time (1900 gmt) and last at least until 6 p.m. (2200 gmt), when a communique is expected to be issued. Italian sources said Italian acting Finance Minister Giovanni Goria met Treasury Secretary James Baker last night.

U.K	735	738	http://dbpedia.org/resource/United_Kingdom	Britain intends to negotiate further agreements on international securities regulation to match those now in force with the U.S. And Japan, government sources said. The Department of Trade and Industry said earlier it had concluded a memorandum of understanding with Japans Finance Ministry to swap supervisory and investigatory information. The agreement covers stocks, shares and government bonds, but not commodity futures, whose regulation in Japan does not come under the Finance Ministry. It therefore does not cover some transactions on the London International Financial Futures Exchange and the London commodities and metal exchanges. The DTI said it hoped to seek further understandings with other countries which met in the U.K. Last December. The meeting involved delegates from the U.K., Switzerland, the U.S., Canada, Australia, Hong Kong, Japan, France, West Germany and Holland. Government sources said the deal with Japan completes arrangements linking Tokyo, the U.S. And London. A U.K. Agreement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) was signed last September. Todays agreement will deal with requests for information on a case by case basis, U.K. Government sources said.

Lawton Chiles	140	153	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Lawton_Chiles	The Senate Budget Committee ended its stalemate over a budget plan and approved by a single vote a revised 1988 budget proposed by chairman Lawton Chiles to cut the deficit to 133.7 billion next year. The new plan broke last weeks gridlock in which the committee failed to approve a similar Chiles plan on a tie vote. Today, the measure was sent to the Senate 13 to 11. Among a series of changes to get the extra vote, Chiles added about 400 million dlrs for additional, unspecified, agricultural spending programs to be paid with partly with higher user fees.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Chile	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Chile_national_football_team	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Concepción,_Chile	http://dbpedia.org/resource/List_of_rivers_of_Chile	http://dbpedia.org/resource/List_of_airports_in_Chile	http://dbpedia.org/resource/President_of_Chile	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Regions_of_Chile	http://dbpedia.org/resource/University_of_Chile	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Provinces_of_Chile	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Communes_of_Chile	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Lawton,_Oklahoma	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Copa_Chile	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Club_Universidad_de_Chile	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Senate_of_Chile	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Time_in_Chile	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Chamber_of_Deputies_of_Chile	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Osorno,_Chile	http://dbpedia.org/resource/La_Serena,_Chile	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Canal_13_(Chile)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Primera_B_de_Chile
Boeing	799	805	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Boeing	Faulty repair work by The Boeing Company BA.N was a contributary cause to a Japan Air Lines Co Ltd JAPN.Y 747 crash on August 12, 1985, that killed 520 people, the final draft of a Ministry of Transport report says. There were only four survivors when the aircraft crashed into a mountain north of Tokyo. The report said inadequate inspection of the aircraft by Japanese inspectors after the repairs was another factor in the crash. The crew were cleared of any responsibility for the disaster. The report, which was sent on March 23 to the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board for comment, should be released in late May. Under an international convention the draft must be submitted for final comments to the relevant authorities. Boeing spokesmen were unavailable for comment. On April 4, a Boeing spokesman at the firms headquarters said the company would probably make no comment on the Japanese investigation teams report until it was officially released. On September 6, 1985, Boeing said in a statement that the 1978 repairs it had undertaken were faulty. This statement did not, however, connect the faulty repairs with the cause of the crash.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Boeing_737	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Boeing_727	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Boeing_747	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Boeing_707	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Boeing_757	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Boeing_767	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Boeing_777	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Boeing_737_Classic	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Boeing_B-17_Flying_Fortress	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Boeing_B-29_Superfortress	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Boeing_747-400	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Boeing_737_Next_Generation	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Boeing_B-52_Stratofortress	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Boeing_CH-47_Chinook	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Boeing_787_Dreamliner	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Boeing_KC-135_Stratotanker	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Boeing_Field	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Boeing_717	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Boeing_720	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Boeing_B-47_Stratojet
Dominion Textile	794	810	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dominion_Textile	Dominion Textile Inc considers a published report that it has bought a stake in Burlington Industries Inc and is considering making a joint bid for the company to be a rumor, a company spokesman said. As far as I am concerned and the company is concerned, they are rumors and were not commenting on rumors, spokesman Michel Dufour told Reuters in response to a query. All the information that has been given out publicly is that, yes, Dominion Textile is interested in making an acquisition that big...probably based on that people are starting all sorts of rumors, he said. Dufour said yes when asked whether the report was only a rumor, but said the company was not prepared to comment further. Dominion Textile president and chairman Thomas Bell was out of town and unavailable for comment. Dominion Textile last year made an unsuccesful 104-mln- U.S.-dlr bid for Avondale Mills and has maintained a 120-mln- U.S.-dlr line of credit to be used for an American acquisition. Dufour said the company has been negotiating with many U.S. textile companies but would not say whether Burlington Industries was one of them. Burlingtons stock rose sharply this morning on the report, which said Dominion Textile had joined with U.S. investor Asher Edelman to buy a stake in the company and to consider making a takeover offer. Dominion Textile, which reported operating profit of 11.1 mln Canadian dlrs last year on sales of 926.5 mln dlrs, has repeatedly said it will concentrate on expanding into the U.S. The company has said it plans to diversify into new product and market areas in addition to expanding its textile operations.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Textile	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dominion	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dominion_of_Newfoundland	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Textile_manufacturing	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Old_Dominion_University	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Textile_industry	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Spinning_(textiles)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Spindle_(textiles)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Kings_Dominion	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dominion_of_Ceylon	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dominion_of_Pakistan	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Textile_Bowl	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dominion_of_India	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Textile_arts	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dominion_Lands_Act	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Toronto-Dominion_Bank	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Textile_printing	http://dbpedia.org/resource/The_Dominion_Post_(Wellington)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Stitch_(textile_arts)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dominion_Range
London	581	587	http://dbpedia.org/resource/London	Major cocoa exporters are likely to limit sales in the weeks ahead in an effort to boost world prices, sources close to a meeting of the Cocoa Producers Alliance (CPA) said. The sources said the depressed world market had been one of the main topics discussed in a closed door meeting of the 11-member CPA which began on Monday. They said producers agreed that cutting sales would aid the buffer stock manager of a new international cocoa pact in his effort to support prices. Major cocoa producing and consuming nations agreed operation rules for the buffer stock at a meeting in London last month and the stock manager is expected to enter the market soon. Prices, under the weight of three successive cocoa surpluses, recently fell to the level at which the manager has to buy cocoa under stock rules. The buffer stock aims to keep prices within a pre-set range by buying when prices fall and selling when they rise. The worlds cocoa price at present is just not interesting, commented one delegate representing a major CPA producer. Another source said that with much of the 1986/87 (October-September) world cocoa crop sold, limiting sales in the near term concerns essentially next years harvest. The sources noted, however, that the cocoa industry in Brazil, the worlds number two producer, is in private hands. This means limiting sales is more difficult than in major West African producers, where sales are made or authorized by commodity marketing boards. The CPA includes the worlds top three producers, Ivory Coast, Brazil and Ghana, and accounts for 80 pct of all output. The meeting here is due to end tomorrow evening.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/University_of_London	http://dbpedia.org/resource/London,_Ontario	http://dbpedia.org/resource/University_College_London	http://dbpedia.org/resource/King's_College_London	http://dbpedia.org/resource/City_of_London	http://dbpedia.org/resource/London_School_of_Economics	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Greater_London	http://dbpedia.org/resource/London_Underground	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Chelsea,_London	http://dbpedia.org/resource/London_Stock_Exchange	http://dbpedia.org/resource/London_and_North_Eastern_Railway	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Imperial_College_London	http://dbpedia.org/resource/London,_Midland_and_Scottish_Railway	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tower_of_London	http://dbpedia.org/resource/New_London,_Connecticut	http://dbpedia.org/resource/South_London	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Wimbledon,_London	http://dbpedia.org/resource/London_and_North_Western_Railway	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Lord_Mayor_of_London	http://dbpedia.org/resource/North_London
London Stock Exchanges	330	352	http://dbpedia.org/resource/London_Stock_Exchange	Exchanges and telecommunications authorities should abolish their restrictions on full and free dissemination of information to the investment and banking communities, Reuters Holdings Plc RTRS.L chairman Sir Christopher Hogg said. In the 1986 annual repoprt, he said lengthy negotiations had brought agreement with the Tokyo and London Stock Exchanges for fuller, but still not complete, access to market data through Reuter services. Many other markets maintain restrictions, he added. Hogg said members of some markets appear to believe that information restrictions protected their interests. In other cases, exchanges seem to be limiting the distribution of data in order to provide competitive advantage to their own commercial information businesses. He also noted that despite increasing liberalisation in the telecommunications field, some countries continue to protect their state monopolies at the expense of other economic sectors. Reuter dealing services remain excluded from such countries. As a result, banking communities serving entire economies are put at a competitive disadvantage, he added. Reuters increased its 1986 pre-tax profit by 39 pct from the previous year to 130.1 mln stg on a 43 pct rise in revenues to 620.9 mln stg. Earnings per ordinary share were up 47 pct to 19.4p.

Reuters	209	216	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Reuters	Storage problems with Brazils record grain crop are likely to result in losses of about five mln tonnes, an Agriculture Ministry spokesman said. Ministry spokesman Leonardo Brito, speaking from Brasilia, told Reuters he believed that about five mln tonnes of this years estimated crop of 65 mln tonnes would be lost. He said part of this would be the normal loss inevitable in harvesting, but that most of it would stem from storage problems. Brazil has a storage capacity of 66 mln tonnes, theoretically sufficient for the crop. But Brito said that the storage capacity was badly distributed. The states of Sao Paulo, Parana and Rio Grande do Sul had between them 70 pct of the nations capacity, but were responsible for only 50 to 60 pct of production. The biggest problems are concentrated in the Centre-West growing regions, where rising production has outpaced storage capacity. Brito said the Centre-West, whose crops include soya and maize, had between 30 and 40 pct of the nations grains production but only 20 pct of its storage space. In addition to the poor distribution of storage units, there is the problem that too much of the capacity is geared to storing grain in sacks, while not enough is suitable for storing loose grain, Brito said. Finally, there is a shortage of lorries to transport the crops. The sheer scale of the task in transporting the record crop has been evident from television reports, which have shown enormous queues of lorries waiting outside granaries.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thomson_Reuters	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Reuters_Group	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Reuters_3000_Xtra	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thomson_Reuters_Foundation	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thomson_Reuters_Indices	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thomson_Reuters_Citation_Laureates	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Reuters_Digital_Vision_Program	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Reuters_Institute_for_the_Study_of_Journalism	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thomson_Reuters_Business_Classification	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Reuters_TV	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Reuters_Insider	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Reuters_Market_Data_System	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Calais_(Reuters_product)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thomson_Reuters_Realized_Volatility_Index	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thomson_Reuters_Messenger	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Reuters_Market_Light	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Reuters_Instrument_Code	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thomson_Reuters_league_tables
Poland	227	233	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Poland	Plans to rejuvenate Polands economy by reducing central government control would help reassure Western creditors that the countrys economy was safe to invest in, a senior Polish official said. The business of granting loans to Poland is not as bad a business as you might imagine, senior Polish government spokesman Jerzy Urban told a news conference in Stockholm. Urban, visiting the Swedish capital to deliver a lecture at the Foreign Policy Institute, announced earlier this week that Poland would soon offer shares to private citizens in state companies in a bid to make the economy more responsive. This was part of a major economic reform to be announced in the coming weeks, he said. Urban said the main problem with his countrys foreign debt burden of 32 billion dollars was short term interest charges but the long term looked more secure. He said he hoped talks under way with the Paris Club, grouping Polands main government creditors, would shortly solve the problem of short term servicing. Urban told reporters that debt servicing was hampering the expansion of the national economy, but that the new plans for economic reform would open new vistas for Polish exports. He criticised the blocking efforts of some Western governments, whom he declined to name, for putting political considerations ahead of economic co-operation. After the lifting of U.S. Sanctions against the Polish economy we considered all political obstacles had been removed, but that has not been the case, Urban said.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Voivodeships_of_Poland	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Greater_Poland_Voivodeship	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Lesser_Poland_Voivodeship	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Congress_Poland	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Invasion_of_Poland	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Poland_national_football_team	http://dbpedia.org/resource/First_Partition_of_Poland	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Partitions_of_Poland	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Crown_of_the_Kingdom_of_Poland	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Lesser_Poland	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Nysa,_Poland	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Greater_Poland	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Turek,_Poland	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Flight_and_expulsion_of_Germans_from_Poland_during_and_after_World_War_II	http://dbpedia.org/resource/TVN_(Poland)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Puck,_Poland	http://dbpedia.org/resource/President_of_Poland	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cross_of_Merit_(Poland)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/History_of_Poland	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Police,_Poland
Dominion	931	939	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dominion_Textile	The largest U.S. textile maker focused on its own business as its competitors found merger partners, but now Burlington Industries Inc may have restructured itself into an attractive takeover candidate, analysts said. The takeover spotlight fell today on Burlington, which rose 4-7/8 to 52-7/8 on speculation that investor Asher Edelman and Dominion Textiles Inc of Canada bought an almost five pct stake. A published report said Edelman and Dominion jointly acquired a stake in Burlington and were weighing a takeover offer. Edelman would not comment, and a spokesman for Montreal-based Dominion called the report just rumors. Burlington said it did not know if the report was true. Wall Street professionals said they were not convinced of the story or that Edelman and Dominion would be the victors if Burlington actually came into play. Arbitragers said past comments from Dominion, however, added credence to the speculation. Dominion has said that it was looking for a takeover in the U.S. Last year, Dominion unsuccessfully bid for Avondale Mills and has maintained a 120 mln dlr line of credit to be used for a U.S. acquisition. A Dominion spokesman said Canadas largest textile producer has been negotiating with many U.S. textile companies, but would not say whether Burlington was among them. There have been acquisitions in this area. Its not unusual that someone could be looking at Burlington after the housecleaning theyve done, said Eileen Gormley of Thomson McKinnon. Burlington sold its domestic operations, which made sheets and other linens, to J.P. Stevens and Co Inc for 110 mln dlrs last year. It also has reorganized management, and focused its operations on businesses that would be less affected by foreign competition, Gormley said. Theyve pulled back so as not to be a commodity marketer, said Gormley. She said in moving more heavily into industrial fabrics, Burlington bought C.H. Masland, which supplies carpets and other fabric to the auto industry. In the past, they just spent and never realized the return on the outlays they did make, she said. You look at their record over the year, and I think theyre poised to be more profitable than they had been in the past, Gormley said. She estimated 1987 earnings of 2.50 dlrs per share, up from 2.01 dlrs per share. Some analysts today recommended clients not buy Burlington at its current levels. Edward Johnson of Johnson Redbook said he recommends selling. He said he believes the stock is worth only about 50 dlrs on a takeover basis and about 46 dlrs on an earnings basis. Some arbitragers, however, said takeover values have been placed on the company of 60 to 65 dlrs per share. After Ashers (Edelman) recent history, a lot of people dont find him very credible anymore, said one arbitrager. Another, however, said Edelman succeeds in forcing managements to take steps to enhance shareholder values even if he doesnt win the target company.

Dominion	877	885	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dominion_Textile	The largest U.S. textile maker focused on its own business as its competitors found merger partners, but now Burlington Industries Inc may have restructured itself into an attractive takeover candidate, analysts said. The takeover spotlight fell today on Burlington, which rose 4-7/8 to 52-7/8 on speculation that investor Asher Edelman and Dominion Textiles Inc of Canada bought an almost five pct stake. A published report said Edelman and Dominion jointly acquired a stake in Burlington and were weighing a takeover offer. Edelman would not comment, and a spokesman for Montreal-based Dominion called the report just rumors. Burlington said it did not know if the report was true. Wall Street professionals said they were not convinced of the story or that Edelman and Dominion would be the victors if Burlington actually came into play. Arbitragers said past comments from Dominion, however, added credence to the speculation. Dominion has said that it was looking for a takeover in the U.S. Last year, Dominion unsuccessfully bid for Avondale Mills and has maintained a 120 mln dlr line of credit to be used for a U.S. acquisition. A Dominion spokesman said Canadas largest textile producer has been negotiating with many U.S. textile companies, but would not say whether Burlington was among them. There have been acquisitions in this area. Its not unusual that someone could be looking at Burlington after the housecleaning theyve done, said Eileen Gormley of Thomson McKinnon. Burlington sold its domestic operations, which made sheets and other linens, to J.P. Stevens and Co Inc for 110 mln dlrs last year. It also has reorganized management, and focused its operations on businesses that would be less affected by foreign competition, Gormley said. Theyve pulled back so as not to be a commodity marketer, said Gormley. She said in moving more heavily into industrial fabrics, Burlington bought C.H. Masland, which supplies carpets and other fabric to the auto industry. In the past, they just spent and never realized the return on the outlays they did make, she said. You look at their record over the year, and I think theyre poised to be more profitable than they had been in the past, Gormley said. She estimated 1987 earnings of 2.50 dlrs per share, up from 2.01 dlrs per share. Some analysts today recommended clients not buy Burlington at its current levels. Edward Johnson of Johnson Redbook said he recommends selling. He said he believes the stock is worth only about 50 dlrs on a takeover basis and about 46 dlrs on an earnings basis. Some arbitragers, however, said takeover values have been placed on the company of 60 to 65 dlrs per share. After Ashers (Edelman) recent history, a lot of people dont find him very credible anymore, said one arbitrager. Another, however, said Edelman succeeds in forcing managements to take steps to enhance shareholder values even if he doesnt win the target company.

CME	1156	1159	http://dbpedia.org/resource/CME_Group	The Chicago Mercantile Exchange, CME, said it has added a new chief compliance officer and will expand its regulatory surveillance program. Paul OKelly, currently assistant regional administrator of the Securities and Exchange Commission, was named vice-president of compliance for the exchange, the CME said. The expanded compliance program, which calls for an increase in the exchanges compliance budget and addition of staff, was in response to recent criticisms that the CMEs current surveillance was not able to keep up with increased demands of recent volatility and volume, the CME said. The new surveillance program calls for the addition of three floor investigators and five compliance investigators, the CME said. Some of the new staff will monitor the exchanges new Computerized Trade Reconstruction system, scheduled to start July 1. In addition, three computer programmers will be added to assist in regulatory support for the exchanges management information system department. Recent criticism has been especially directed at the CMEs Standard and Poors stock index futures and options division. A special membership referendum to prohibit CME members from filling customer orders and trading for their own account in S and P 500 futures and options will be voted on April 13. In a letter dated March 12, CME chairman John Sandner and Executive committee chairman Leo Melamed urged members to reject the referendum in favor a series of new rules. Included in the rule changes was the requirement that futures brokers in the S and P pit manually record all personal trades to the nearest minute, intended to enhance the effectiveness of surveillance and compliance functions, We made a promise to our members that we have kept, Melamed said in a release today. He said the new surveillance program represents a commitment to a vigorous enforcement policy.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/CME_Group_Tour_Championship	http://dbpedia.org/resource/2013_CME_Group_Titleholders	http://dbpedia.org/resource/2015_CME_Group_Tour_Championship	http://dbpedia.org/resource/CME_SPAN	http://dbpedia.org/resource/2012_CME_Group_Titleholders	http://dbpedia.org/resource/2011_CME_Group_Titleholders	http://dbpedia.org/resource/2014_CME_Group_Tour_Championship	http://dbpedia.org/resource/2016_CME_Group_Tour_Championship	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Phillips_Chapel_CME_Church
United States	2222	2235	http://dbpedia.org/resource/United_States	Senior Japanese officials tomorrow open talks with American trade negotiators in a last-ditch effort to avert new high U.S. tariffs to be imposed on a wide variety of Japanese electronic exports. Makoto Kuroda, vice minister of Japans Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI), is to hold two days of meetings with the Deputy U.S. Trade Representative, Michael Smith, and the Under Secretary of Commerce, Bruce Smart. The new tariffs, to go into effect on April 17, are in retaliation for Japans failure to adhere to an agreement to end dumping semiconductors in world markets at below cost and to open its home market to U.S. semiconductor shipments. They are to be imposed on goods which use semiconductors, including television and audio equipment and computers. Both U.S. and Japanese officials have said there was little likelihood the talks would do anything to avert the 100 pct duties on 300 mln dlrs worth of Japanese shipments. President Reagan announced the planned tariffs on March 27 after he said that close monitoring of the July 1986 U.S.-Japanese semiconductor pact convinced U.S. officials that Japan was not honoring the agreement. In making the annoucement, Reagan said I am committed to the full enforcement of our trade agreements designed to provide American industry with free and fair trade. Trade analysts said his move was aimed as much at Japans semiconductor trade practices, which are said to have injured the U.S. semiconductor industry, as Congress, which has complained about presidential timidity on trade issues. Congressional Democrats have pledged to enact aggressive trade laws to counter what they contend has been Reagans inaction to redress the growing U.S. trade deficit, which last year reached 169.8 billion dlrs. About one-third of the deficit was with Japan. Reagan said there were recent signs Japan was beginning to adhere to the pact and that was why he was not terminating it. Kuroda said on leaving Tokyo today he had no new proposals but did have an explanation of the semiconductor situation. He told the daily newspaper Ashai Shimbun that Reagans decision was based on inaccurate data and an exaggerated sense of MITIs power to control Japanese traders. The United States has excessive expectations., he said. To stabilize supply-demand relations which have been disrupted by excess inventories since 1985 will take some time. He also said that U.S. firms had not been aggressive enough in trying to sell in the Japanese market.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/United_Kingdom	http://dbpedia.org/resource/U.S._state	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Political_divisions_of_the_United_States	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Democratic_Party_(United_States)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Republican_Party_(United_States)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/List_of_sovereign_states	http://dbpedia.org/resource/United_States_Census_Bureau	http://dbpedia.org/resource/United_States_Navy	http://dbpedia.org/resource/United_States_Army	http://dbpedia.org/resource/2010_United_States_Census	http://dbpedia.org/resource/United_States_Geological_Survey	http://dbpedia.org/resource/United_Nations	http://dbpedia.org/resource/United_States_Senate	http://dbpedia.org/resource/United_States_dollar	http://dbpedia.org/resource/United_States_House_of_Representatives	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Township_(United_States)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Georgia_(U.S._state)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/United_States_Air_Force	http://dbpedia.org/resource/United_States_Congress	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Washington_(state)
Chaco	764	769	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Chaco_Province	Argentine grain producers adjusted their yield estimates for the 1986/87 coarse grain crop downward in the week to yesterday after the heavy rains at the end of March and beginning of April, trade sources said. They said sunflower, maize and sorghum production estimates had been reduced despite some later warm, dry weather, which has allowed a return to harvesting in some areas. However, as showers fell intermittently after last weekend, producers feared another spell of prolonged and intense rain could cause more damage to crops already badly hit this season. Rains in the middle of last week reached an average of 27 millimetres in parts of Buenos Aires province, 83 mm in Cordoba, 41 in Santa Fe, 50 in Entre Rios and Misiones, 95 in Corrientes, eight in Chaco and 35 in Formosa. There was no rainfall in the same period in La Pampa. Producers feared continued damp conditions could produce rotting and lead to still lower yield estimates for all the crops, including soybean. However, as the lands began drying later in the week harvesting advanced considerably, reaching between 36 and 40 pct of the area sown in the case of sunflower. Deterioration of the sunflower crop evident in harvested material in Cordoba, La Pampa and Buenos Aires forced yield estimates per hectare to be adjusted down again. The seasons sunflowerseed production is now forecast at 2.1 mln to 2.3 mln tonnes, against 2.2 mln to 2.4 mln forecast last week and down 43.9 to 48.8 pct on the 1985/86 record of 4.1 mln. Area sown to sunflowers was two to 2.2 mln hectares, 29.9 to 36.3 pct below the record 3.14 mln hectares last season. Maize harvesting has also reached 36 to 40 pct of the area sown. It is near completion in Cordoba and Santa Fe and will begin in La Pampa and southern Buenos Aires later in April. Production estimates for maize were down from last week at 9.5 mln to 9.8 mln tonnes, against 9.6 mln to 9.9 mln estimated previously. This is 22.2 to 23.4 pct below the 12.4 mln to 12.6 mln tonnes estimated by private sources for the 1985/86 crop and 21.9 to 25.8 pct down on the official figure of 12.8 mln tonnes. Maize was sown on 3.58 mln to 3.78 mln hectares, two to seven pct down on last seasons 3.85 mln. Sorghum was harvested on 23 to 25 pct of the area sown in Cordoba, Santa Fe and Chaco. Harvest will start in La Pampa and Buenos Aires in mid-April. The total area sown was 1.23 mln to 1.30 mln hectares, 10.3 to 15.2 pct down on the 1.45 mln sown last season. The new forecast for the sorghum crop is 2.9 mln to 3.2 mln tonnes compared with three mln to 3.3 mln forecast last week, and is 23.8 to 29.3 pct down on last seasons 4.1 mln to 4.2 mln tonne crop. The soybean crop for this season was not adjusted, remaining at a record 7.5 mln to 7.7 mln tonnes, up 4.2 to 5.5 pct on the 7.2 mln to 7.3 mln estimated by private sources for 1985/86 and 5.6 to 8.5 pct higher than the official figure of 7.1 mln. The area sown to soybeans this season was a record 3.7 mln to 3.8 mln hectares, 10.8 to 13.8 pct up on the record 3.34 mln sown in 1985/86. The soybean crop is showing excessive moisture in some areas and producers fear they may discover more damage. Some experimental harvesting was carried out in Santa Fe on areas making up only about one pct of the total crop but details on this were not available. Preparation of the fields for the 1987/88 wheat crop, which will be sown between May and August or September, has so far not been as intense as in previous years.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Gran_Chaco	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Chaco_War	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Resistencia,_Chaco	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Chaco_Culture_National_Historical_Park	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Chaco_Petrolero	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Estadio_Defensores_del_Chaco	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Gran_Chaco_Province	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Chaco_For_Ever	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Chaco_(Paraguay)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Chaco_Wash	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Chaco_eagle	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bermejo_Department,_Chaco	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Chaco_(spider)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Governor_of_Chaco_Province	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Chaco_Open	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Chaco_sanjuanina	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Chaco_tecka	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Chaco_patagonica	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Chaco_socos	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Chaco_earthcreeper
Samuel Heyman	1891	1904	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Samuel_J._Heyman	Cheap oil feedstocks, the weakened U.S. dollar and a plant utilization rate approaching 90 pct will propel the streamlined U.S. petrochemical industry to record profits this year, with growth expected through at least 1990, major company executives predicted. This bullish outlook for chemical manufacturing and an industrywide move to shed unrelated businesses has prompted GAF Corp (GAF), privately-held Cain Chemical Inc, and other firms to aggressively seek acquisitions of petrochemical plants. Oil companies such as Ashland Oil Inc (ASH), the Kentucky-based oil refiner and marketer, are also shopping for money-making petrochemical businesses to buy. I see us poised at the threshold of a golden period, said Paul Oreffice, chairman of giant Dow Chemical Co (DOW), adding, Theres no major plant capacity being added around the world now. The whole game is bringing out new products and improving the old ones. Analysts say the chemical industrys biggest customers, automobile manufacturers and home builders that use a lot of paints and plastics, are expected to buy quantities this year. U.S. petrochemical plants are currently operating at about 90 pct capacity, reflecting tighter supply that could hike product prices by 30 to 40 pct this year, said John Dosher, managing director of Pace Consultants Inc of Houston. Demand for some products such as styrene could push profit margins up by as much as 300 pct, he said. Oreffice, speaking at a meeting of chemical engineers in Houston, said Dow would easily top the 741 mln dlrs it earned last year and predicted it would have the best year in its history. In 1985, when oil prices were still above 25 dlrs a barrel and chemical exports were adversely affected by the strong U.S. dollar, Dow had profits of 58 mln dlrs. I believe the entire chemical industry is headed for a record year or close to it, Oreffice said. GAF chairman Samuel Heyman estimated that the U.S. chemical industry would report a 20 pct gain in profits during 1987. Last year, the domestic industry earned a total of 13 billion dlrs, a 54 pct leap from 1985. The turn in the fortunes of the once-sickly chemical industry has been brought about by a combination of luck and planning, said Paces John Dosher. Dosher said last years fall in oil prices made feedstocks dramatically cheaper and at the same time the American dollar was weakening against foreign currencies. That helped boost U.S. chemical exports. Also helping to bring supply and demand into balance has been the gradual market absorption of the extra chemical manufacturing capacity created by Middle Eastern oil producers in the early 1980s. Finally, virtually all major U.S. chemical manufacturers have embarked on an extensive corporate restructuring program to mothball inefficient plants, trim the payroll and eliminate unrelated businesses. The restructuring touched off a flurry of friendly and hostile takeover attempts. GAF, which made an unsuccessful attempt in 1985 to acquire Union Carbide Corp UK, recently offered three billion dlrs for Borg Warner Corp BOR, a Chicago manufacturer of plastics and chemicals. Another industry powerhouse, W.R. Grace (GRA) has divested its retailing, restaurant and fertilizer businesses to raise cash for chemical acquisitions. But some experts worry that the chemical industry may be headed for trouble if companies continue turning their back on the manufacturing of staple petrochemical commodities, such as ethylene, in favor of more profitable specialty chemicals that are custom-designed for a small group of buyers. Companies like DuPont (DD) and Monsanto Co MTC spent the past two or three years trying to get out of the commodity chemical business in reaction to how badly the market had deteriorated, Dosher said. But I think they will eventually kill the margins on the profitable chemicals in the niche market. Some top chemical executives share the concern. The challenge for our industry is to keep from getting carried away and repeating past mistakes, GAFs Heyman cautioned. The shift from commodity chemicals may be ill-advised. Specialty businesses do not stay special long. Houston-based Cain Chemical, created this month by the Sterling investment banking group, believes it can generate 700 mln dlrs in annual sales by bucking the industry trend. Chairman Gordon Cain, who previously led a leveraged buyout of Duponts Conoco Incs chemical business, has spent 1.1 billion dlrs since January to buy seven petrochemical plants along the Texas Gulf Coast. The plants produce only basic commodity petrochemicals that are the building blocks of specialty products. This kind of commodity chemical business will never be a glamorous, high-margin business, Cain said, adding that demand is expected to grow by about three pct annually. Garo Armen, an analyst with Dean Witter Reynolds, said chemical makers have also benefitted by increasing demand for plastics as prices become more competitive with aluminum, wood and steel products.

Tokyo	298	303	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tokyo	Faulty repair work by The Boeing Company BA.N was a contributary cause to a Japan Air Lines Co Ltd JAPN.Y 747 crash on August 12, 1985, that killed 520 people, the final draft of a Ministry of Transport report says. There were only four survivors when the aircraft crashed into a mountain north of Tokyo. The report said inadequate inspection of the aircraft by Japanese inspectors after the repairs was another factor in the crash. The crew were cleared of any responsibility for the disaster. The report, which was sent on March 23 to the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board for comment, should be released in late May. Under an international convention the draft must be submitted for final comments to the relevant authorities. Boeing spokesmen were unavailable for comment. On April 4, a Boeing spokesman at the firms headquarters said the company would probably make no comment on the Japanese investigation teams report until it was officially released. On September 6, 1985, Boeing said in a statement that the 1978 repairs it had undertaken were faulty. This statement did not, however, connect the faulty repairs with the cause of the crash.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/TV_Tokyo	http://dbpedia.org/resource/University_of_Tokyo	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tokyo_Broadcasting_System	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Chiyoda,_Tokyo	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tokyo_Verdy	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Minato,_Tokyo	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tokyo_Station	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tokyo_Bay	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tokyo_Metro	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ōta,_Tokyo	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tokyo_Dome	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Chūō,_Tokyo	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tokyo_Yakult_Swallows	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hachiōji,_Tokyo	http://dbpedia.org/resource/FC_Tokyo	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tokyo_International_Film_Festival	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tokyo_Stock_Exchange	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tokyo_Metropolitan_Television	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tokyo_Disneyland	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Adachi,_Tokyo
Wall Street	219	230	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Wall_Street	Promising new findings in the use of a controversial experimental drug called Interleukin-2 as a cure for cancer will be published in the April 9 issue of the prestigious New England Journal of Medicine, according to a Wall Street analyst who has obtained an advance copy of the magazine. Among interleukins principal U. S. makers are Cetus Corp CTUS, headquartered in Emeryville, Calif., and Immunex Corp IMNX, based in Seattle, Wash. The journal, to be released late today, contains two articles reporting high remission rates several cancer types. The journal also contains a signed editorial concluding that the new results mark a significant milestone in the search for a successful immunotherapy for cancer. Interleukin-2, also known as IL-2, is a substance naturally produced by living cells in the laboratory. The drug is controversial because it was widely praised as a promising cancer treatment in early reports on its effectiveness in late 1985, only to come under criticism a year later for its failure to live up to its promise and due to its ravaging side effects. One of the new studies, conducted by Dr. William West of Biotherapeutics Inc of Franklin, Tenn., is particularly significant because it found far fewer harsh side effects after it changed the way in which the drug is administered. In that study, researchers administered IL-2 to 48 cancer patients and found a 50-pct remission rate for kidney cancers and a 50 pct remission rate for melanoma, a type of skin cancer, according to Prudential-Bache Securities Stuart Weisbrod, who obtained the advance copy of the magazine. For rectal and colon cancer, the researchers found no remissions, but none of the 48 patients treated had side effects serious enough to be placed under intensive hospital care, according to the article. In the second study, whose principal author is Dr. Steven Rosenberg of the National Cancer Institute, researchers administered IL-2 to 157 cancer patients and found a 33 pct remission rate in cancers of the kidney, a 27 pct rate in melanomas and a 15 pct rate in cancers of the colon and rectum. In the National Cancer Institute trials, a total of four patients died, the magazine reported, confirming the harshness of the drugs side effects as originally administered. Perhaps we are at the end of the beginning of the search for successful immunotherapy for cancer, said the editorial, signed by John Durant of Philadelphias Chase Cancer Center. These observations reported by Rosenberg and West surely did not describe successful practical approaches ready for widespread applications in the therapy of cancer patients, the editorial said. On the other hand, if they reflect, as seems possible, a successful manipulation of the cellular immune system, then we may be near the end of our search for a meaningful direction in the immunuotherapy of cancer, the editorial concluded.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/The_Wall_Street_Journal	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Coronation_Street	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sesame_Street	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Berlin_Wall	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Street	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hadrian's_Wall	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Fleet_Street	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Street_art	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Defensive_wall	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Wall	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Occupy_Wall_Street	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cell_wall	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Fourth_wall	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Shortland_Street	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Yonge_Street	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Oxford_Street	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Wall_Street_Crash_of_1929	http://dbpedia.org/resource/10_Downing_Street	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Regent_Street	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Street_food

Dominion Textile	1321	1337	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dominion_Textile	Dominion Textile Inc considers a published report that it has bought a stake in Burlington Industries Inc and is considering making a joint bid for the company to be a rumor, a company spokesman said. As far as I am concerned and the company is concerned, they are rumors and were not commenting on rumors, spokesman Michel Dufour told Reuters in response to a query. All the information that has been given out publicly is that, yes, Dominion Textile is interested in making an acquisition that big...probably based on that people are starting all sorts of rumors, he said. Dufour said yes when asked whether the report was only a rumor, but said the company was not prepared to comment further. Dominion Textile president and chairman Thomas Bell was out of town and unavailable for comment. Dominion Textile last year made an unsuccesful 104-mln- U.S.-dlr bid for Avondale Mills and has maintained a 120-mln- U.S.-dlr line of credit to be used for an American acquisition. Dufour said the company has been negotiating with many U.S. textile companies but would not say whether Burlington Industries was one of them. Burlingtons stock rose sharply this morning on the report, which said Dominion Textile had joined with U.S. investor Asher Edelman to buy a stake in the company and to consider making a takeover offer. Dominion Textile, which reported operating profit of 11.1 mln Canadian dlrs last year on sales of 926.5 mln dlrs, has repeatedly said it will concentrate on expanding into the U.S. The company has said it plans to diversify into new product and market areas in addition to expanding its textile operations.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Textile	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dominion	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dominion_of_Newfoundland	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Textile_manufacturing	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Old_Dominion_University	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Textile_industry	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Spinning_(textiles)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Spindle_(textiles)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Kings_Dominion	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dominion_of_Ceylon	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dominion_of_Pakistan	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Textile_Bowl	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dominion_of_India	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Textile_arts	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dominion_Lands_Act	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Toronto-Dominion_Bank	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Textile_printing	http://dbpedia.org/resource/The_Dominion_Post_(Wellington)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Stitch_(textile_arts)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dominion_Range

Tokyo	320	325	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tokyo_Stock_Exchange	Exchanges and telecommunications authorities should abolish their restrictions on full and free dissemination of information to the investment and banking communities, Reuters Holdings Plc RTRS.L chairman Sir Christopher Hogg said. In the 1986 annual repoprt, he said lengthy negotiations had brought agreement with the Tokyo and London Stock Exchanges for fuller, but still not complete, access to market data through Reuter services. Many other markets maintain restrictions, he added. Hogg said members of some markets appear to believe that information restrictions protected their interests. In other cases, exchanges seem to be limiting the distribution of data in order to provide competitive advantage to their own commercial information businesses. He also noted that despite increasing liberalisation in the telecommunications field, some countries continue to protect their state monopolies at the expense of other economic sectors. Reuter dealing services remain excluded from such countries. As a result, banking communities serving entire economies are put at a competitive disadvantage, he added. Reuters increased its 1986 pre-tax profit by 39 pct from the previous year to 130.1 mln stg on a 43 pct rise in revenues to 620.9 mln stg. Earnings per ordinary share were up 47 pct to 19.4p.

Pennzoil	677	685	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Getty_Oil	First Boston Corp analyst William Randol recommended the purchase of Texaco Inc today, saying the discount that investors have made in the share price to reflect the ongoing litigation with Pennzoil has been overdone relative to how we expect the case to conclude. Texacos stock rose 1/8 to 34-1/8. On Monday, the stock tumbled four points after the Supreme Court overturned a lower court decision that cut Texacos bond in the 10.3 billion dlr legal dispute with Pennzoil Co PZL to one billion dlrs. Yesterday, a Texas court granted a temporary injunction on the bond issue pending a hearing next week. The current litigation arose from Texacos buyout of Getty Oil Co in 1984. Pennzoil sued, arguing its earlier agreement to buy Getty was binding. Two Texas state courts upheld Pennzoils position. Randol, noting that the stock has suffered a great deal in the two years since the litigation was filed, said we recognize the legal problems but think investors have overdone it. He said the stock is selling at 48 pct of its asset value, and we think it represents a good value at this level.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pennzoil	http://dbpedia.org/resource/2000_Pennzoil_400	http://dbpedia.org/resource/2013_Shell-Pennzoil_Grand_Prix_of_Houston	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pennzoil_Place	http://dbpedia.org/resource/1999_Pennzoil_400	http://dbpedia.org/resource/2001_Pennzoil_Freedom_400	http://dbpedia.org/resource/1997_Pennzoil_200

Dow	1748	1751	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dow_Chemical_Company	Cheap oil feedstocks, the weakened U.S. dollar and a plant utilization rate approaching 90 pct will propel the streamlined U.S. petrochemical industry to record profits this year, with growth expected through at least 1990, major company executives predicted. This bullish outlook for chemical manufacturing and an industrywide move to shed unrelated businesses has prompted GAF Corp (GAF), privately-held Cain Chemical Inc, and other firms to aggressively seek acquisitions of petrochemical plants. Oil companies such as Ashland Oil Inc (ASH), the Kentucky-based oil refiner and marketer, are also shopping for money-making petrochemical businesses to buy. I see us poised at the threshold of a golden period, said Paul Oreffice, chairman of giant Dow Chemical Co (DOW), adding, Theres no major plant capacity being added around the world now. The whole game is bringing out new products and improving the old ones. Analysts say the chemical industrys biggest customers, automobile manufacturers and home builders that use a lot of paints and plastics, are expected to buy quantities this year. U.S. petrochemical plants are currently operating at about 90 pct capacity, reflecting tighter supply that could hike product prices by 30 to 40 pct this year, said John Dosher, managing director of Pace Consultants Inc of Houston. Demand for some products such as styrene could push profit margins up by as much as 300 pct, he said. Oreffice, speaking at a meeting of chemical engineers in Houston, said Dow would easily top the 741 mln dlrs it earned last year and predicted it would have the best year in its history. In 1985, when oil prices were still above 25 dlrs a barrel and chemical exports were adversely affected by the strong U.S. dollar, Dow had profits of 58 mln dlrs. I believe the entire chemical industry is headed for a record year or close to it, Oreffice said. GAF chairman Samuel Heyman estimated that the U.S. chemical industry would report a 20 pct gain in profits during 1987. Last year, the domestic industry earned a total of 13 billion dlrs, a 54 pct leap from 1985. The turn in the fortunes of the once-sickly chemical industry has been brought about by a combination of luck and planning, said Paces John Dosher. Dosher said last years fall in oil prices made feedstocks dramatically cheaper and at the same time the American dollar was weakening against foreign currencies. That helped boost U.S. chemical exports. Also helping to bring supply and demand into balance has been the gradual market absorption of the extra chemical manufacturing capacity created by Middle Eastern oil producers in the early 1980s. Finally, virtually all major U.S. chemical manufacturers have embarked on an extensive corporate restructuring program to mothball inefficient plants, trim the payroll and eliminate unrelated businesses. The restructuring touched off a flurry of friendly and hostile takeover attempts. GAF, which made an unsuccessful attempt in 1985 to acquire Union Carbide Corp UK, recently offered three billion dlrs for Borg Warner Corp BOR, a Chicago manufacturer of plastics and chemicals. Another industry powerhouse, W.R. Grace (GRA) has divested its retailing, restaurant and fertilizer businesses to raise cash for chemical acquisitions. But some experts worry that the chemical industry may be headed for trouble if companies continue turning their back on the manufacturing of staple petrochemical commodities, such as ethylene, in favor of more profitable specialty chemicals that are custom-designed for a small group of buyers. Companies like DuPont (DD) and Monsanto Co MTC spent the past two or three years trying to get out of the commodity chemical business in reaction to how badly the market had deteriorated, Dosher said. But I think they will eventually kill the margins on the profitable chemicals in the niche market. Some top chemical executives share the concern. The challenge for our industry is to keep from getting carried away and repeating past mistakes, GAFs Heyman cautioned. The shift from commodity chemicals may be ill-advised. Specialty businesses do not stay special long. Houston-based Cain Chemical, created this month by the Sterling investment banking group, believes it can generate 700 mln dlrs in annual sales by bucking the industry trend. Chairman Gordon Cain, who previously led a leveraged buyout of Duponts Conoco Incs chemical business, has spent 1.1 billion dlrs since January to buy seven petrochemical plants along the Texas Gulf Coast. The plants produce only basic commodity petrochemicals that are the building blocks of specialty products. This kind of commodity chemical business will never be a glamorous, high-margin business, Cain said, adding that demand is expected to grow by about three pct annually. Garo Armen, an analyst with Dean Witter Reynolds, said chemical makers have also benefitted by increasing demand for plastics as prices become more competitive with aluminum, wood and steel products. Armen estimated the upturn in the chemical business could last as long as four or five years, provided the U.S. economy continues its modest rate of growth.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dow_Jones_&_Company	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dow_Jones_Industrial_Average	http://dbpedia.org/resource/John_Dow_Fisher_Gilchrist	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dow_Corning	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dow_Finsterwald	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tony_Dow	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dow_AgroSciences	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dow_Medical_College	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Arthur_Wesley_Dow	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Alden_B._Dow	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Marion_Merrell_Dow	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dow_Event_Center	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mike_Dow	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dow_Constantine	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bill_Dow	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hugh_Dow	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Willie_Dow	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Charles_Dow	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Neal_Dow	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dow_Crag
Canada	824	830	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Canada	Britain intends to negotiate further agreements on international securities regulation to match those now in force with the U.S. And Japan, government sources said. The Department of Trade and Industry said earlier it had concluded a memorandum of understanding with Japans Finance Ministry to swap supervisory and investigatory information. The agreement covers stocks, shares and government bonds, but not commodity futures, whose regulation in Japan does not come under the Finance Ministry. It therefore does not cover some transactions on the London International Financial Futures Exchange and the London commodities and metal exchanges. The DTI said it hoped to seek further understandings with other countries which met in the U.K. Last December. The meeting involved delegates from the U.K., Switzerland, the U.S., Canada, Australia, Hong Kong, Japan, France, West Germany and Holland. Government sources said the deal with Japan completes arrangements linking Tokyo, the U.S. And London. A U.K. Agreement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) was signed last September. Todays agreement will deal with requests for information on a case by case basis, U.K. Government sources said.

A spokesman said VWs supervisory board will meet tomorrow to discuss the payout. A statement will be made afterwards. VW has also said disclosed profits for 1986 will reach their 1985 level, despite provisions of a possible 480 mln marks linked to the currency affair. The figure is virtually the same as the 477 mln mark 1985 parent company net profit. When VW first confirmed the currency scandal on March 10 it said the management board would propose an unchanged 10-mark dividend to the supervisory board. A dividend of 11 marks would be proposed for the companys new preference shares. Share analysts said they saw supervisory board approval of the management board proposal as virtually a formality. Anything else would be more than a surprise, one said. Company sources said VW would have to dig into reserves to maintain the disclosed profit.

Brazil	1258	1264	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Brazil	Major cocoa exporters are likely to limit sales in the weeks ahead in an effort to boost world prices, sources close to a meeting of the Cocoa Producers Alliance (CPA) said. The sources said the depressed world market had been one of the main topics discussed in a closed door meeting of the 11-member CPA which began on Monday. They said producers agreed that cutting sales would aid the buffer stock manager of a new international cocoa pact in his effort to support prices. Major cocoa producing and consuming nations agreed operation rules for the buffer stock at a meeting in London last month and the stock manager is expected to enter the market soon. Prices, under the weight of three successive cocoa surpluses, recently fell to the level at which the manager has to buy cocoa under stock rules. The buffer stock aims to keep prices within a pre-set range by buying when prices fall and selling when they rise. The worlds cocoa price at present is just not interesting, commented one delegate representing a major CPA producer. Another source said that with much of the 1986/87 (October-September) world cocoa crop sold, limiting sales in the near term concerns essentially next years harvest. The sources noted, however, that the cocoa industry in Brazil, the worlds number two producer, is in private hands. This means limiting sales is more difficult than in major West African producers, where sales are made or authorized by commodity marketing boards. The CPA includes the worlds top three producers, Ivory Coast, Brazil and Ghana, and accounts for 80 pct of all output. The meeting here is due to end tomorrow evening.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/States_of_Brazil	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Municipalities_of_Brazil	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Regions_of_Brazil	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Northeast_Region,_Brazil	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Brazil_national_football_team	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Southeast_Region,_Brazil	http://dbpedia.org/resource/South_Region,_Brazil	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ministry_of_Transport_(Brazil)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Time_in_Brazil	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Federal_District_(Brazil)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Colonial_Brazil	http://dbpedia.org/resource/President_of_Brazil	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Workers'_Party_(Brazil)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mesoregions_of_Brazil	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Empire_of_Brazil	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Microregions_of_Brazil	http://dbpedia.org/resource/North_Region,_Brazil	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Central-West_Region,_Brazil	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Football_in_Brazil	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pedro_II_of_Brazil

Federal member of parliament for the region,  Charles-Eugene Marin, said last week the federal government is also prepared to provide financial help to restart operations as soon as possible. Noranda has estimated damage from the fire at about 10 mln dlrs and a company spokesman said it should have a more specific estimate by the end of the month.

Japan	1851	1856	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Japan	Senior Japanese officials tomorrow open talks with American trade negotiators in a last-ditch effort to avert new high U.S. tariffs to be imposed on a wide variety of Japanese electronic exports. Makoto Kuroda, vice minister of Japans Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI), is to hold two days of meetings with the Deputy U.S. Trade Representative, Michael Smith, and the Under Secretary of Commerce, Bruce Smart. The new tariffs, to go into effect on April 17, are in retaliation for Japans failure to adhere to an agreement to end dumping semiconductors in world markets at below cost and to open its home market to U.S. semiconductor shipments. They are to be imposed on goods which use semiconductors, including television and audio equipment and computers. Both U.S. and Japanese officials have said there was little likelihood the talks would do anything to avert the 100 pct duties on 300 mln dlrs worth of Japanese shipments. President Reagan announced the planned tariffs on March 27 after he said that close monitoring of the July 1986 U.S.-Japanese semiconductor pact convinced U.S. officials that Japan was not honoring the agreement. In making the annoucement, Reagan said I am committed to the full enforcement of our trade agreements designed to provide American industry with free and fair trade. Trade analysts said his move was aimed as much at Japans semiconductor trade practices, which are said to have injured the U.S. semiconductor industry, as Congress, which has complained about presidential timidity on trade issues. Congressional Democrats have pledged to enact aggressive trade laws to counter what they contend has been Reagans inaction to redress the growing U.S. trade deficit, which last year reached 169.8 billion dlrs. About one-third of the deficit was with Japan. Reagan said there were recent signs Japan was beginning to adhere to the pact and that was why he was not terminating it. Kuroda said on leaving Tokyo today he had no new proposals but did have an explanation of the semiconductor situation. He told the daily newspaper Ashai Shimbun that Reagans decision was based on inaccurate data and an exaggerated sense of MITIs power to control Japanese traders. The United States has excessive expectations., he said. To stabilize supply-demand relations which have been disrupted by excess inventories since 1985 will take some time. He also said that U.S. firms had not been aggressive enough in trying to sell in the Japanese market.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/East_Japan_Railway_Company	http://dbpedia.org/resource/West_Japan_Railway_Company	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Empire_of_Japan	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Japan_Football_League	http://dbpedia.org/resource/List_of_towns_in_Japan	http://dbpedia.org/resource/National_highways_of_Japan	http://dbpedia.org/resource/List_of_railway_stations_in_Japan	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Districts_of_Japan	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Liberal_Democratic_Party_(Japan)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Municipalities_of_Japan	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cinema_of_Japan	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Japan_national_football_team	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Japan_Hot_100	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sea_of_Japan	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Prefectures_of_Japan	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Central_Japan_Railway_Company	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Japan_Standard_Time	http://dbpedia.org/resource/King_Records_(Japan)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cities_of_Japan	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Surrender_of_Japan

GAF	2925	2928	http://dbpedia.org/resource/GAF_Materials_Corporation	Cheap oil feedstocks, the weakened U.S. dollar and a plant utilization rate approaching 90 pct will propel the streamlined U.S. petrochemical industry to record profits this year, with growth expected through at least 1990, major company executives predicted. This bullish outlook for chemical manufacturing and an industrywide move to shed unrelated businesses has prompted GAF Corp (GAF), privately-held Cain Chemical Inc, and other firms to aggressively seek acquisitions of petrochemical plants. Oil companies such as Ashland Oil Inc (ASH), the Kentucky-based oil refiner and marketer, are also shopping for money-making petrochemical businesses to buy. I see us poised at the threshold of a golden period, said Paul Oreffice, chairman of giant Dow Chemical Co (DOW), adding, Theres no major plant capacity being added around the world now. The whole game is bringing out new products and improving the old ones. Analysts say the chemical industrys biggest customers, automobile manufacturers and home builders that use a lot of paints and plastics, are expected to buy quantities this year. U.S. petrochemical plants are currently operating at about 90 pct capacity, reflecting tighter supply that could hike product prices by 30 to 40 pct this year, said John Dosher, managing director of Pace Consultants Inc of Houston. Demand for some products such as styrene could push profit margins up by as much as 300 pct, he said. Oreffice, speaking at a meeting of chemical engineers in Houston, said Dow would easily top the 741 mln dlrs it earned last year and predicted it would have the best year in its history. In 1985, when oil prices were still above 25 dlrs a barrel and chemical exports were adversely affected by the strong U.S. dollar, Dow had profits of 58 mln dlrs. I believe the entire chemical industry is headed for a record year or close to it, Oreffice said. GAF chairman Samuel Heyman estimated that the U.S. chemical industry would report a 20 pct gain in profits during 1987. Last year, the domestic industry earned a total of 13 billion dlrs, a 54 pct leap from 1985. The turn in the fortunes of the once-sickly chemical industry has been brought about by a combination of luck and planning, said Paces John Dosher. Dosher said last years fall in oil prices made feedstocks dramatically cheaper and at the same time the American dollar was weakening against foreign currencies. That helped boost U.S. chemical exports. Also helping to bring supply and demand into balance has been the gradual market absorption of the extra chemical manufacturing capacity created by Middle Eastern oil producers in the early 1980s. Finally, virtually all major U.S. chemical manufacturers have embarked on an extensive corporate restructuring program to mothball inefficient plants, trim the payroll and eliminate unrelated businesses. The restructuring touched off a flurry of friendly and hostile takeover attempts. GAF, which made an unsuccessful attempt in 1985 to acquire Union Carbide Corp UK, recently offered three billion dlrs for Borg Warner Corp BOR, a Chicago manufacturer of plastics and chemicals. Another industry powerhouse, W.R. Grace (GRA) has divested its retailing, restaurant and fertilizer businesses to raise cash for chemical acquisitions. But some experts worry that the chemical industry may be headed for trouble if companies continue turning their back on the manufacturing of staple petrochemical commodities, such as ethylene, in favor of more profitable specialty chemicals that are custom-designed for a small group of buyers. Companies like DuPont (DD) and Monsanto Co MTC spent the past two or three years trying to get out of the commodity chemical business in reaction to how badly the market had deteriorated, Dosher said. But I think they will eventually kill the margins on the profitable chemicals in the niche market. Some top chemical executives share the concern. The challenge for our industry is to keep from getting carried away and repeating past mistakes, GAFs Heyman cautioned. The shift from commodity chemicals may be ill-advised. Specialty businesses do not stay special long. Houston-based Cain Chemical, created this month by the Sterling investment banking group, believes it can generate 700 mln dlrs in annual sales by bucking the industry trend. Chairman Gordon Cain, who previously led a leveraged buyout of Duponts Conoco Incs chemical business, has spent 1.1 billion dlrs since January to buy seven petrochemical plants along the Texas Gulf Coast. The plants produce only basic commodity petrochemicals that are the building blocks of specialty products. This kind of commodity chemical business will never be a glamorous, high-margin business, Cain said, adding that demand is expected to grow by about three pct annually. Garo Armen, an analyst with Dean Witter Reynolds, said chemical makers have also benefitted by increasing demand for plastics as prices become more competitive with aluminum, wood and steel products. Armen estimated the upturn in the chemical business could last as long as four or five years, provided the U.S. economy continues its modest rate of growth.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/GAF_Nomad	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Gaf	http://dbpedia.org/resource/GAF_Jindivik	http://dbpedia.org/resource/GAF_domain	http://dbpedia.org/resource/1976_Sabah_Air_GAF_Nomad_crash
Southern Co	193	204	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Southern_Company	An audit submitted to the Georgia Public Service Commission claims that between 944 mln dlrs and 1.8 billion dlrs of the costs of the Plant Vogtle nuclear power station should be disallowed, a Southern Co spokeswoman said. Southerns Georgia Power Co subsidiary has a 45.7 pct interest in the plant and estimated earlier this year it would cost a total of 8.87 billion dlrs. Last year, the plants owners pledged to Georgia regulators they would limit the cost passed on to rate payers to 8.4 billion dlrs. The Southern spokeswoman said the company feels the report by OBrien-Kreitzberg is flawed and biased. She said the report was released yesterday by the state attorney general. Responding to the report today, Georgia Power Chairman Robert W. Scherer told a news conference the conclusions drawn by the firm are not only wrong -- they also reflect the same bias against nuclear power that these auditors have demonstrated in similar cases accross the country. Saying he was not suggesting Georgia power was without fault, Scherer said the audit identified several things I wish we had done differently. Scherer pointed out a report OBrien-Kreitzberg submitted to Georgia regulators in March 1986 projected Georgia Power would not finish Plant Vogtle unit one before the end of 1987. Noting unit one is finished, and we expect it to be in commercial operationg by June, he said the firms latest report ignored the earlier projection, gave the utility no credit for the completion and actually penalized us by suggesting that costs to maintain t he schedule be disallowed. Scherer said the latest audit alleges Georgia Power could have saved 95 mln dlrs if it had stopped using four shifts, seven days a week to speed construction three years sooner. He said this would have delayed completion of the plant for another year and it would have cost several hunderd million dlrs more. Noting the audit said costs were increased 600 mln dlrs by schedule delays totaling 20.5 months, he said First, we have the best concrete placement record in the industry, Second new government regulations after the Three Mile Island incident significantly increased construction time.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/University_of_Southern_California	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Southern_California	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Southern_United_States	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Southern_Football_League	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Southern_Conference	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Southern_Ocean	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Southern_rock	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Southern_Methodist_University	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Southern_Africa	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Southern_Rhodesia	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Norfolk_Southern_Railway	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Southern_Hemisphere	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Southern_Province,_Sri_Lanka	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Southern_Association_of_Colleges_and_Schools	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Southern_Baptist_Convention	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Southern_Italy	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Southern_Netherlands	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Southern_Illinois_University	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Southern_League_(baseball)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Southern_hip_hop

Supreme Court	350	363	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States	First Boston Corp analyst William Randol recommended the purchase of Texaco Inc today, saying the discount that investors have made in the share price to reflect the ongoing litigation with Pennzoil has been overdone relative to how we expect the case to conclude. Texacos stock rose 1/8 to 34-1/8. On Monday, the stock tumbled four points after the Supreme Court overturned a lower court decision that cut Texacos bond in the 10.3 billion dlr legal dispute with Pennzoil Co PZL to one billion dlrs. Yesterday, a Texas court granted a temporary injunction on the bond issue pending a hearing next week. The current litigation arose from Texacos buyout of Getty Oil Co in 1984. Pennzoil sued, arguing its earlier agreement to buy Getty was binding. Two Texas state courts upheld Pennzoils position. Randol, noting that the stock has suffered a great deal in the two years since the litigation was filed, said we recognize the legal problems but think investors have overdone it. He said the stock is selling at 48 pct of its asset value, and we think it represents a good value at this level.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Supreme_Court_of_Canada	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tennis_court	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Court	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Supreme_Court_of_India	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Clay_court	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Supreme_court	http://dbpedia.org/resource/High_Court_of_Justice	http://dbpedia.org/resource/European_Court_of_Justice	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Supreme_Court_of_Norway	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Iowa_Supreme_Court	http://dbpedia.org/resource/European_Court_of_Human_Rights	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Supreme_Court_of_Victoria	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Court_of_Appeal_of_New_Zealand	http://dbpedia.org/resource/International_Court_of_Justice	http://dbpedia.org/resource/List_of_United_States_Supreme_Court_cases	http://dbpedia.org/resource/United_States_Court_of_Appeals_for_the_Ninth_Circuit	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Court_of_Appeal_of_England_and_Wales	http://dbpedia.org/resource/High_Court_of_New_Zealand	http://dbpedia.org/resource/High_Court_of_Australia	http://dbpedia.org/resource/New_York_Supreme_Court

Armen estimated the upturn in the chemical business could last as long as four or five years, provided the U.S. economy continues its modest rate of growth.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Garo_people	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Garo_Hills	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Armen_Takhtajan	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Armen_Dzhigarkhanyan	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Garo_(TV_series)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Garo_(magazine)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Margaret_Armen	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Garo_language	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Armen_Nazaryan	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Armen_Tigranian	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Garo_Yepremian	http://dbpedia.org/resource/West_Garo_Hills_district	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Kingdom_of_Garo	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Garo_Mafyan	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Armen_Keteyian	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Armen_Vardanyan	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Armen_Alchian	http://dbpedia.org/resource/East_Garo_Hills_district	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Armen_Garo	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Armen_Petrosyan

The need for about 130 to 150 new pilots has been created by the Pan AM shuttle, it said. Processing of applicants began March 30 and the first class of new-hire pilots will begin training on APril 15. Pan Am said it also completed the recall of more than 250 pilots. Most of the new hires will begin as flight engineers, but as many as 50 will move directly into the first officer position, it said.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/World_War_II	http://dbpedia.org/resource/World_War_I	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pan_American_Games	http://dbpedia.org/resource/World_Weightlifting_Championships	http://dbpedia.org/resource/World_Bank	http://dbpedia.org/resource/World_music	http://dbpedia.org/resource/World	http://dbpedia.org/resource/2015_Pan_American_Games	http://dbpedia.org/resource/World_Health_Organization	http://dbpedia.org/resource/World_Heritage_Site	http://dbpedia.org/resource/World_Rowing_Championships	http://dbpedia.org/resource/2011_Pan_American_Games	http://dbpedia.org/resource/2003_World_Artistic_Gymnastics_Championships	http://dbpedia.org/resource/World_Series	http://dbpedia.org/resource/2007_Pan_American_Games	http://dbpedia.org/resource/FIFA_World_Cup	http://dbpedia.org/resource/2003_Pan_American_Games	http://dbpedia.org/resource/New_World	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Guinness_World_Records	http://dbpedia.org/resource/2015_Trampoline_World_Championships
John Shad	35	44	http://dbpedia.org/resource/John_S.R._Shad	Securities and Exchange Commission John Shad said he wanted Congress to write a better definition of insider trading but thought action should wait until the Supreme Court ruled on an insider trading case. Id like the benefit of the Winans decision before deciding on a definition, Shad told a Senate Appropriations subcommittee hearing. Shad was refering to the appeal by former Wall Street Journal reporter R. Foster Winans of his conviction on insider trading charges for telling a friend in advance what stocks he was going to write about in his column. The stocks usually went up or down in price depending on Winans recommendation. He said insider trading accounted for only 11 percent of the SECs enforcement activities last year despite the publicity given to recent major cases. Insider trading makes up only a tiny fraction of one pct of the 50 billion dlrs of daily securities trading, Shad said. Shad asked for a budget increase so the SEC could enlarge its enforcement staff by 20 this year and 73 next year to deal with all types of securities fraud. Shad said he hoped to start his new duties as U.S. Ambassador to the Netherlands by June. He said he did not know when his successor would be named by President Reagan.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Johns_Hopkins_University	http://dbpedia.org/resource/John_Lennon	http://dbpedia.org/resource/John_F._Kennedy	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pope_John_Paul_II	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Elton_John	http://dbpedia.org/resource/John_McCain	http://dbpedia.org/resource/John_Peel	http://dbpedia.org/resource/John_Kerry	http://dbpedia.org/resource/John_Milton	http://dbpedia.org/resource/John_the_Baptist	http://dbpedia.org/resource/John_Gould	http://dbpedia.org/resource/John_Coltrane	http://dbpedia.org/resource/John_Wayne	http://dbpedia.org/resource/John_Wesley	http://dbpedia.org/resource/John_Edward_Gray	http://dbpedia.org/resource/John_Cage	http://dbpedia.org/resource/John_Wiley_&_Sons	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Saint_John,_New_Brunswick	http://dbpedia.org/resource/John_Adams	http://dbpedia.org/resource/John_Howard
Japan	1123	1128	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Japan	Senior Japanese officials tomorrow open talks with American trade negotiators in a last-ditch effort to avert new high U.S. tariffs to be imposed on a wide variety of Japanese electronic exports. Makoto Kuroda, vice minister of Japans Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI), is to hold two days of meetings with the Deputy U.S. Trade Representative, Michael Smith, and the Under Secretary of Commerce, Bruce Smart. The new tariffs, to go into effect on April 17, are in retaliation for Japans failure to adhere to an agreement to end dumping semiconductors in world markets at below cost and to open its home market to U.S. semiconductor shipments. They are to be imposed on goods which use semiconductors, including television and audio equipment and computers. Both U.S. and Japanese officials have said there was little likelihood the talks would do anything to avert the 100 pct duties on 300 mln dlrs worth of Japanese shipments. President Reagan announced the planned tariffs on March 27 after he said that close monitoring of the July 1986 U.S.-Japanese semiconductor pact convinced U.S. officials that Japan was not honoring the agreement. In making the annoucement, Reagan said I am committed to the full enforcement of our trade agreements designed to provide American industry with free and fair trade. Trade analysts said his move was aimed as much at Japans semiconductor trade practices, which are said to have injured the U.S. semiconductor industry, as Congress, which has complained about presidential timidity on trade issues. Congressional Democrats have pledged to enact aggressive trade laws to counter what they contend has been Reagans inaction to redress the growing U.S. trade deficit, which last year reached 169.8 billion dlrs. About one-third of the deficit was with Japan. Reagan said there were recent signs Japan was beginning to adhere to the pact and that was why he was not terminating it. Kuroda said on leaving Tokyo today he had no new proposals but did have an explanation of the semiconductor situation. He told the daily newspaper Ashai Shimbun that Reagans decision was based on inaccurate data and an exaggerated sense of MITIs power to control Japanese traders. The United States has excessive expectations., he said. To stabilize supply-demand relations which have been disrupted by excess inventories since 1985 will take some time. He also said that U.S. firms had not been aggressive enough in trying to sell in the Japanese market.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/East_Japan_Railway_Company	http://dbpedia.org/resource/West_Japan_Railway_Company	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Empire_of_Japan	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Japan_Football_League	http://dbpedia.org/resource/List_of_towns_in_Japan	http://dbpedia.org/resource/National_highways_of_Japan	http://dbpedia.org/resource/List_of_railway_stations_in_Japan	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Districts_of_Japan	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Liberal_Democratic_Party_(Japan)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Municipalities_of_Japan	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cinema_of_Japan	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Japan_national_football_team	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Japan_Hot_100	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sea_of_Japan	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Prefectures_of_Japan	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Central_Japan_Railway_Company	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Japan_Standard_Time	http://dbpedia.org/resource/King_Records_(Japan)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cities_of_Japan	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Surrender_of_Japan

Santa Fe	2281	2289	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Santa_Fe_Province	Argentine grain producers adjusted their yield estimates for the 1986/87 coarse grain crop downward in the week to yesterday after the heavy rains at the end of March and beginning of April, trade sources said. They said sunflower, maize and sorghum production estimates had been reduced despite some later warm, dry weather, which has allowed a return to harvesting in some areas. However, as showers fell intermittently after last weekend, producers feared another spell of prolonged and intense rain could cause more damage to crops already badly hit this season. Rains in the middle of last week reached an average of 27 millimetres in parts of Buenos Aires province, 83 mm in Cordoba, 41 in Santa Fe, 50 in Entre Rios and Misiones, 95 in Corrientes, eight in Chaco and 35 in Formosa. There was no rainfall in the same period in La Pampa. Producers feared continued damp conditions could produce rotting and lead to still lower yield estimates for all the crops, including soybean. However, as the lands began drying later in the week harvesting advanced considerably, reaching between 36 and 40 pct of the area sown in the case of sunflower. Deterioration of the sunflower crop evident in harvested material in Cordoba, La Pampa and Buenos Aires forced yield estimates per hectare to be adjusted down again. The seasons sunflowerseed production is now forecast at 2.1 mln to 2.3 mln tonnes, against 2.2 mln to 2.4 mln forecast last week and down 43.9 to 48.8 pct on the 1985/86 record of 4.1 mln. Area sown to sunflowers was two to 2.2 mln hectares, 29.9 to 36.3 pct below the record 3.14 mln hectares last season. Maize harvesting has also reached 36 to 40 pct of the area sown. It is near completion in Cordoba and Santa Fe and will begin in La Pampa and southern Buenos Aires later in April. Production estimates for maize were down from last week at 9.5 mln to 9.8 mln tonnes, against 9.6 mln to 9.9 mln estimated previously. This is 22.2 to 23.4 pct below the 12.4 mln to 12.6 mln tonnes estimated by private sources for the 1985/86 crop and 21.9 to 25.8 pct down on the official figure of 12.8 mln tonnes. Maize was sown on 3.58 mln to 3.78 mln hectares, two to seven pct down on last seasons 3.85 mln. Sorghum was harvested on 23 to 25 pct of the area sown in Cordoba, Santa Fe and Chaco. Harvest will start in La Pampa and Buenos Aires in mid-April. The total area sown was 1.23 mln to 1.30 mln hectares, 10.3 to 15.2 pct down on the 1.45 mln sown last season. The new forecast for the sorghum crop is 2.9 mln to 3.2 mln tonnes compared with three mln to 3.3 mln forecast last week, and is 23.8 to 29.3 pct down on last seasons 4.1 mln to 4.2 mln tonne crop. The soybean crop for this season was not adjusted, remaining at a record 7.5 mln to 7.7 mln tonnes, up 4.2 to 5.5 pct on the 7.2 mln to 7.3 mln estimated by private sources for 1985/86 and 5.6 to 8.5 pct higher than the official figure of 7.1 mln. The area sown to soybeans this season was a record 3.7 mln to 3.8 mln hectares, 10.8 to 13.8 pct up on the record 3.34 mln sown in 1985/86. The soybean crop is showing excessive moisture in some areas and producers fear they may discover more damage. Some experimental harvesting was carried out in Santa Fe on areas making up only about one pct of the total crop but details on this were not available. Preparation of the fields for the 1987/88 wheat crop, which will be sown between May and August or September, has so far not been as intense as in previous years.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Santa_Fe,_New_Mexico	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Santa_Catarina_(state)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Santa_Barbara,_California	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Santa_Monica,_California	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Santa_Fe,_Argentina	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Santa_Claus	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Rosario,_Santa_Fe	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Santa_Cruz,_California	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Santa_Clara,_California	http://dbpedia.org/resource/St._John's_College_(Annapolis/Santa_Fe)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/University_of_California,_Santa_Barbara	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Santa_Clara_University	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Santa_Ana,_California	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Atchison,_Topeka_and_Santa_Fe_Railway	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Santa_Rosa,_California	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Santa_Fe_Trail	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Unión_de_Santa_Fe	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Independiente_Santa_Fe	http://dbpedia.org/resource/University_of_California,_Santa_Cruz	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Santa_Cruz_de_la_Sierra
Karl Otto Poehl	260	275	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Karl_Otto_Pöhl	Top officials of leading industrial nations arrived at the U.S. Treasury main building to begin a meeting of the Group of Five. Officials seen arriving by Reuter correspondents included West German Finance Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg and Bundesbank President Karl Otto Poehl, French Finance Minister Edouard Balladur and his central banker Jacques de Larosiere. Also seen arriving were Japanese Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa and Japans central bank governor Satoshi Sumita and British Chancellor of the Exchequer and central bank governor Robin Leigh Pemberton. There was no immediate sign of Italian or Canadian officials. Monetary sources have said a fully blown meeting of the Group of Seven is expected to begin around 3 p.m. local time (1900 gmt) and last at least until 6 p.m. (2200 gmt), when a communique is expected to be issued. Italian sources said Italian acting Finance Minister Giovanni Goria met Treasury Secretary James Baker last night. At those talks Baker apparently convinced Goria, who declined to attend the February meeting of the Group of Seven in Paris, that Italy would participate fully in any meaningful decisions.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Karl_Marx	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Otto_Staudinger	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Otto_von_Bismarck	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Otto_Kuntze	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Karl_Popper	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Karl_Lagerfeld	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Karl_Jordan	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Karl_Barth	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Karl_Wilhelm_Reinmuth	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Karl_Dönitz	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Otto_Stapf	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Karl_Rove	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Karl_Pearson	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Otto_Preminger	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Otto_Harbach	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Karl_Moritz_Schumann	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Karl_Schäfer_Memorial	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Otto_of_Greece	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Karl_May	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Karl_Patterson_Schmidt
U.S	818	821	http://dbpedia.org/resource/United_States	Britain intends to negotiate further agreements on international securities regulation to match those now in force with the U.S. And Japan, government sources said. The Department of Trade and Industry said earlier it had concluded a memorandum of understanding with Japans Finance Ministry to swap supervisory and investigatory information. The agreement covers stocks, shares and government bonds, but not commodity futures, whose regulation in Japan does not come under the Finance Ministry. It therefore does not cover some transactions on the London International Financial Futures Exchange and the London commodities and metal exchanges. The DTI said it hoped to seek further understandings with other countries which met in the U.K. Last December. The meeting involved delegates from the U.K., Switzerland, the U.S., Canada, Australia, Hong Kong, Japan, France, West Germany and Holland. Government sources said the deal with Japan completes arrangements linking Tokyo, the U.S. And London. A U.K. Agreement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) was signed last September. Todays agreement will deal with requests for information on a case by case basis, U.K. Government sources said. It is not legally binding and comes into force immediately.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/U.S._state	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Georgia_(U.S._state)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/List_of_counties_in_Georgia_(U.S._state)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/List_of_rivers_of_Georgia_(U.S._state)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Supreme_Court_of_Georgia_(U.S._state)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Paleontology_in_Georgia_(U.S._state)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Commonwealth_(U.S._state)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/List_of_U.S._state_songs	http://dbpedia.org/resource/List_of_tallest_buildings_by_U.S._state	http://dbpedia.org/resource/List_of_U.S._state_soils	http://dbpedia.org/resource/List_of_U.S._states_by_elevation	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Miss_Georgia_(U.S._state)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/List_of_U.S._state_flowers	http://dbpedia.org/resource/List_of_U.S._state_birds	http://dbpedia.org/resource/List_of_U.S._state_trees	http://dbpedia.org/resource/U.S._state_constitutional_amendments_banning_same-sex_unions	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Political_party_strength_in_U.S._states	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Flags_of_the_U.S._states	http://dbpedia.org/resource/List_of_National_Historic_Landmarks_in_Georgia_(U.S._state)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/U.S._European_Command_State_Partnership_Program

ASH	539	542	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ashland_Inc.	Cheap oil feedstocks, the weakened U.S. dollar and a plant utilization rate approaching 90 pct will propel the streamlined U.S. petrochemical industry to record profits this year, with growth expected through at least 1990, major company executives predicted. This bullish outlook for chemical manufacturing and an industrywide move to shed unrelated businesses has prompted GAF Corp (GAF), privately-held Cain Chemical Inc, and other firms to aggressively seek acquisitions of petrochemical plants. Oil companies such as Ashland Oil Inc (ASH), the Kentucky-based oil refiner and marketer, are also shopping for money-making petrochemical businesses to buy. I see us poised at the threshold of a golden period, said Paul Oreffice, chairman of giant Dow Chemical Co (DOW), adding, Theres no major plant capacity being added around the world now. The whole game is bringing out new products and improving the old ones. Analysts say the chemical industrys biggest customers, automobile manufacturers and home builders that use a lot of paints and plastics, are expected to buy quantities this year. U.S. petrochemical plants are currently operating at about 90 pct capacity, reflecting tighter supply that could hike product prices by 30 to 40 pct this year, said John Dosher, managing director of Pace Consultants Inc of Houston. Demand for some products such as styrene could push profit margins up by as much as 300 pct, he said. Oreffice, speaking at a meeting of chemical engineers in Houston, said Dow would easily top the 741 mln dlrs it earned last year and predicted it would have the best year in its history. In 1985, when oil prices were still above 25 dlrs a barrel and chemical exports were adversely affected by the strong U.S. dollar, Dow had profits of 58 mln dlrs. I believe the entire chemical industry is headed for a record year or close to it, Oreffice said. GAF chairman Samuel Heyman estimated that the U.S. chemical industry would report a 20 pct gain in profits during 1987. Last year, the domestic industry earned a total of 13 billion dlrs, a 54 pct leap from 1985. The turn in the fortunes of the once-sickly chemical industry has been brought about by a combination of luck and planning, said Paces John Dosher. Dosher said last years fall in oil prices made feedstocks dramatically cheaper and at the same time the American dollar was weakening against foreign currencies. That helped boost U.S. chemical exports. Also helping to bring supply and demand into balance has been the gradual market absorption of the extra chemical manufacturing capacity created by Middle Eastern oil producers in the early 1980s. Finally, virtually all major U.S. chemical manufacturers have embarked on an extensive corporate restructuring program to mothball inefficient plants, trim the payroll and eliminate unrelated businesses. The restructuring touched off a flurry of friendly and hostile takeover attempts. GAF, which made an unsuccessful attempt in 1985 to acquire Union Carbide Corp UK, recently offered three billion dlrs for Borg Warner Corp BOR, a Chicago manufacturer of plastics and chemicals. Another industry powerhouse, W.R. Grace (GRA) has divested its retailing, restaurant and fertilizer businesses to raise cash for chemical acquisitions. But some experts worry that the chemical industry may be headed for trouble if companies continue turning their back on the manufacturing of staple petrochemical commodities, such as ethylene, in favor of more profitable specialty chemicals that are custom-designed for a small group of buyers. Companies like DuPont (DD) and Monsanto Co MTC spent the past two or three years trying to get out of the commodity chemical business in reaction to how badly the market had deteriorated, Dosher said. But I think they will eventually kill the margins on the profitable chemicals in the niche market. Some top chemical executives share the concern. The challenge for our industry is to keep from getting carried away and repeating past mistakes, GAFs Heyman cautioned. The shift from commodity chemicals may be ill-advised. Specialty businesses do not stay special long. Houston-based Cain Chemical, created this month by the Sterling investment banking group, believes it can generate 700 mln dlrs in annual sales by bucking the industry trend. Chairman Gordon Cain, who previously led a leveraged buyout of Duponts Conoco Incs chemical business, has spent 1.1 billion dlrs since January to buy seven petrochemical plants along the Texas Gulf Coast. The plants produce only basic commodity petrochemicals that are the building blocks of specialty products. This kind of commodity chemical business will never be a glamorous, high-margin business, Cain said, adding that demand is expected to grow by about three pct annually. Garo Armen, an analyst with Dean Witter Reynolds, said chemical makers have also benefitted by increasing demand for plastics as prices become more competitive with aluminum, wood and steel products. Armen estimated the upturn in the chemical business could last as long as four or five years, provided the U.S. economy continues its modest rate of growth.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ashes_to_Ashes_(TV_series)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/As-Sawahira_ash-Sharqiya	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Rise_from_the_Ashes	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ash_Coulee	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Umpiring_in_the_1946–47_Ashes_series	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Khabb_wa_ash_Sha'af_District	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ash,_Oregon	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Battle_of_Ash_Hollow	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ash_Grove_Township,_Shelby_County,_Illinois	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ash,_Devon	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Blue_Horizon_(Wishbone_Ash_album)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Wood_ash	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Halaq_ash_Shuqayq	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ash_Dixon	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Up_from_the_Ashes_(Burn_Halo_album)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ken_Ash	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ashes_to_Ashes_(Faith_No_More_song)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/David_Ash_(cricketer)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Southport_Ash_Street_railway_station	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cold_Ash_Hill
Onno Ruding	496	507	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Onno_Ruding	Dutch state-owned chemical firm NV DSM (DSMN.AS), the former Dutch state mines, which today reported a 2.5 pct increase in 1986 net profit to 412 mln guilders, said it was poised to be privatised, possibly next year. DSM chairman Hans van Liemt told journalists We have done our homework. Were ready. It is up to the state now. He said a public sale of 30 pct of DSMs assets in 1988 was not unlikely, but the timing of the sell-off was entirely in the hands of Parliament. Dutch Finance Minister Onno Ruding is known to be a proponent of privatisation, and the centre-right government coalition mentioned plans to privatise DSM in its policy declaration last autumn.

Calif	381	386	http://dbpedia.org/resource/California	Promising new findings in the use of a controversial experimental drug called Interleukin-2 as a cure for cancer will be published in the April 9 issue of the prestigious New England Journal of Medicine, according to a Wall Street analyst who has obtained an advance copy of the magazine. Among interleukins principal U. S. makers are Cetus Corp CTUS, headquartered in Emeryville, Calif., and Immunex Corp IMNX, based in Seattle, Wash. The journal, to be released late today, contains two articles reporting high remission rates several cancer types. The journal also contains a signed editorial concluding that the new results mark a significant milestone in the search for a successful immunotherapy for cancer. Interleukin-2, also known as IL-2, is a substance naturally produced by living cells in the laboratory. The drug is controversial because it was widely praised as a promising cancer treatment in early reports on its effectiveness in late 1985, only to come under criticism a year later for its failure to live up to its promise and due to its ravaging side effects. One of the new studies, conducted by Dr. William West of Biotherapeutics Inc of Franklin, Tenn., is particularly significant because it found far fewer harsh side effects after it changed the way in which the drug is administered. In that study, researchers administered IL-2 to 48 cancer patients and found a 50-pct remission rate for kidney cancers and a 50 pct remission rate for melanoma, a type of skin cancer, according to Prudential-Bache Securities Stuart Weisbrod, who obtained the advance copy of the magazine. For rectal and colon cancer, the researchers found no remissions, but none of the 48 patients treated had side effects serious enough to be placed under intensive hospital care, according to the article. In the second study, whose principal author is Dr. Steven Rosenberg of the National Cancer Institute, researchers administered IL-2 to 157 cancer patients and found a 33 pct remission rate in cancers of the kidney, a 27 pct rate in melanomas and a 15 pct rate in cancers of the colon and rectum. In the National Cancer Institute trials, a total of four patients died, the magazine reported, confirming the harshness of the drugs side effects as originally administered. Perhaps we are at the end of the beginning of the search for successful immunotherapy for cancer, said the editorial, signed by John Durant of Philadelphias Chase Cancer Center. These observations reported by Rosenberg and West surely did not describe successful practical approaches ready for widespread applications in the therapy of cancer patients, the editorial said. On the other hand, if they reflect, as seems possible, a successful manipulation of the cellular immune system, then we may be near the end of our search for a meaningful direction in the immunuotherapy of cancer, the editorial concluded.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Caproni_Vizzola_Calif	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Calif_Records

Miller	1043	1049	http://dbpedia.org/resource/James_C._Miller_III	Office of Management and Budget Director James Miller said President Reagan will reject the tax increase called for in the House Budget Committees 1988 budget proposal which is before the House for a vote today. Its just completely unacceptable, Miller told a House Appropriations subcommittee on Treasury, Postal Service and General Government Appropriations. The plan, drafted by the Democratic-controlled Budget committee, calls for 22 billion dlrs in higher revenues, of which 18 billion would be from new taxes set by the tax-writing committees. The House committees budget proposal includes some increases in federal user fees as well as 18 billion dlrs in taxes. Miller warned that failure to reduce the federal deficit would jeopardize the U.S. economy. If we do not further reduce the deficit... we place this economic expansion that weve had in the last five years at risk, Miller told the subcommittee. The result of any kind of tax increase would be to increase substantially the prospects that the expansion would come to an end, Miller said.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Arthur_Miller	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Glenn_Miller	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Miller	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Marcus_Miller	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Henry_Miller	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Roger_Miller	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Philip_Miller	http://dbpedia.org/resource/P._Schuyler_Miller	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Barney_Miller	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Gerrit_Smith_Miller	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dennis_Miller	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mac_Miller	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ben_Millers	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Frank_Miller_(comics)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Minneapolis_Millers	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mitch_Miller	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Jonathan_Miller	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ernest_Miller_(cinematographer)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Steve_Miller_Band	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sienna_Miller
London	1351	1357	http://dbpedia.org/resource/London	Exchanges and telecommunications authorities should abolish their restrictions on full and free dissemination of information to the investment and banking communities, Reuters Holdings Plc RTRS.L chairman Sir Christopher Hogg said. In the 1986 annual repoprt, he said lengthy negotiations had brought agreement with the Tokyo and London Stock Exchanges for fuller, but still not complete, access to market data through Reuter services. Many other markets maintain restrictions, he added. Hogg said members of some markets appear to believe that information restrictions protected their interests. In other cases, exchanges seem to be limiting the distribution of data in order to provide competitive advantage to their own commercial information businesses. He also noted that despite increasing liberalisation in the telecommunications field, some countries continue to protect their state monopolies at the expense of other economic sectors. Reuter dealing services remain excluded from such countries. As a result, banking communities serving entire economies are put at a competitive disadvantage, he added. Reuters increased its 1986 pre-tax profit by 39 pct from the previous year to 130.1 mln stg on a 43 pct rise in revenues to 620.9 mln stg. Earnings per ordinary share were up 47 pct to 19.4p. The annual shareholder meeting will be held in London on April 29.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/University_of_London	http://dbpedia.org/resource/London,_Ontario	http://dbpedia.org/resource/University_College_London	http://dbpedia.org/resource/King's_College_London	http://dbpedia.org/resource/City_of_London	http://dbpedia.org/resource/London_School_of_Economics	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Greater_London	http://dbpedia.org/resource/London_Underground	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Chelsea,_London	http://dbpedia.org/resource/London_Stock_Exchange	http://dbpedia.org/resource/London_and_North_Eastern_Railway	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Imperial_College_London	http://dbpedia.org/resource/London,_Midland_and_Scottish_Railway	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tower_of_London	http://dbpedia.org/resource/New_London,_Connecticut	http://dbpedia.org/resource/South_London	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Wimbledon,_London	http://dbpedia.org/resource/London_and_North_Western_Railway	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Lord_Mayor_of_London	http://dbpedia.org/resource/North_London
GAFs	4011	4015	http://dbpedia.org/resource/GAF_Materials_Corporation	Cheap oil feedstocks, the weakened U.S. dollar and a plant utilization rate approaching 90 pct will propel the streamlined U.S. petrochemical industry to record profits this year, with growth expected through at least 1990, major company executives predicted. This bullish outlook for chemical manufacturing and an industrywide move to shed unrelated businesses has prompted GAF Corp (GAF), privately-held Cain Chemical Inc, and other firms to aggressively seek acquisitions of petrochemical plants. Oil companies such as Ashland Oil Inc (ASH), the Kentucky-based oil refiner and marketer, are also shopping for money-making petrochemical businesses to buy. I see us poised at the threshold of a golden period, said Paul Oreffice, chairman of giant Dow Chemical Co (DOW), adding, Theres no major plant capacity being added around the world now. The whole game is bringing out new products and improving the old ones. Analysts say the chemical industrys biggest customers, automobile manufacturers and home builders that use a lot of paints and plastics, are expected to buy quantities this year. U.S. petrochemical plants are currently operating at about 90 pct capacity, reflecting tighter supply that could hike product prices by 30 to 40 pct this year, said John Dosher, managing director of Pace Consultants Inc of Houston. Demand for some products such as styrene could push profit margins up by as much as 300 pct, he said. Oreffice, speaking at a meeting of chemical engineers in Houston, said Dow would easily top the 741 mln dlrs it earned last year and predicted it would have the best year in its history. In 1985, when oil prices were still above 25 dlrs a barrel and chemical exports were adversely affected by the strong U.S. dollar, Dow had profits of 58 mln dlrs. I believe the entire chemical industry is headed for a record year or close to it, Oreffice said. GAF chairman Samuel Heyman estimated that the U.S. chemical industry would report a 20 pct gain in profits during 1987. Last year, the domestic industry earned a total of 13 billion dlrs, a 54 pct leap from 1985. The turn in the fortunes of the once-sickly chemical industry has been brought about by a combination of luck and planning, said Paces John Dosher. Dosher said last years fall in oil prices made feedstocks dramatically cheaper and at the same time the American dollar was weakening against foreign currencies. That helped boost U.S. chemical exports. Also helping to bring supply and demand into balance has been the gradual market absorption of the extra chemical manufacturing capacity created by Middle Eastern oil producers in the early 1980s. Finally, virtually all major U.S. chemical manufacturers have embarked on an extensive corporate restructuring program to mothball inefficient plants, trim the payroll and eliminate unrelated businesses. The restructuring touched off a flurry of friendly and hostile takeover attempts. GAF, which made an unsuccessful attempt in 1985 to acquire Union Carbide Corp UK, recently offered three billion dlrs for Borg Warner Corp BOR, a Chicago manufacturer of plastics and chemicals. Another industry powerhouse, W.R. Grace (GRA) has divested its retailing, restaurant and fertilizer businesses to raise cash for chemical acquisitions. But some experts worry that the chemical industry may be headed for trouble if companies continue turning their back on the manufacturing of staple petrochemical commodities, such as ethylene, in favor of more profitable specialty chemicals that are custom-designed for a small group of buyers. Companies like DuPont (DD) and Monsanto Co MTC spent the past two or three years trying to get out of the commodity chemical business in reaction to how badly the market had deteriorated, Dosher said. But I think they will eventually kill the margins on the profitable chemicals in the niche market. Some top chemical executives share the concern. The challenge for our industry is to keep from getting carried away and repeating past mistakes, GAFs Heyman cautioned. The shift from commodity chemicals may be ill-advised. Specialty businesses do not stay special long. Houston-based Cain Chemical, created this month by the Sterling investment banking group, believes it can generate 700 mln dlrs in annual sales by bucking the industry trend. Chairman Gordon Cain, who previously led a leveraged buyout of Duponts Conoco Incs chemical business, has spent 1.1 billion dlrs since January to buy seven petrochemical plants along the Texas Gulf Coast. The plants produce only basic commodity petrochemicals that are the building blocks of specialty products. This kind of commodity chemical business will never be a glamorous, high-margin business, Cain said, adding that demand is expected to grow by about three pct annually. Garo Armen, an analyst with Dean Witter Reynolds, said chemical makers have also benefitted by increasing demand for plastics as prices become more competitive with aluminum, wood and steel products. Armen estimated the upturn in the chemical business could last as long as four or five years, provided the U.S. economy continues its modest rate of growth.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Law_enforcement_in_Argentina	http://dbpedia.org/resource/David_John_Gunn	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Vadapadimangalam_estate	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dublin_Corporation_election,_1899	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Muhammad_Munawar_Khan	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Andy_Centenera	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Jordan_Montgomery	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Flagg-Coburn_House	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Karbi_Youth_Festival	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Garden_Suburb_Theatre	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Andy_Lewis_(cricketer)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Horse_racing_in_the_United_States	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pavitra_(film)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Politics_of_Lombardy	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Crescenzago_(Milan_Metro)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/High_speed_serial_link	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ardbraccan	http://dbpedia.org/resource/The_New_Breed_(The_Outer_Limits)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Georges_Kramer	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Kundarki_(Assembly_constituency)

Tokyo	970	975	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tokyo	Britain intends to negotiate further agreements on international securities regulation to match those now in force with the U.S. And Japan, government sources said. The Department of Trade and Industry said earlier it had concluded a memorandum of understanding with Japans Finance Ministry to swap supervisory and investigatory information. The agreement covers stocks, shares and government bonds, but not commodity futures, whose regulation in Japan does not come under the Finance Ministry. It therefore does not cover some transactions on the London International Financial Futures Exchange and the London commodities and metal exchanges. The DTI said it hoped to seek further understandings with other countries which met in the U.K. Last December. The meeting involved delegates from the U.K., Switzerland, the U.S., Canada, Australia, Hong Kong, Japan, France, West Germany and Holland. Government sources said the deal with Japan completes arrangements linking Tokyo, the U.S. And London. A U.K. Agreement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) was signed last September. Todays agreement will deal with requests for information on a case by case basis, U.K. Government sources said. It is not legally binding and comes into force immediately.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/TV_Tokyo	http://dbpedia.org/resource/University_of_Tokyo	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tokyo_Broadcasting_System	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Chiyoda,_Tokyo	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tokyo_Verdy	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Minato,_Tokyo	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tokyo_Station	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tokyo_Bay	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tokyo_Metro	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ōta,_Tokyo	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tokyo_Dome	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Chūō,_Tokyo	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tokyo_Yakult_Swallows	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hachiōji,_Tokyo	http://dbpedia.org/resource/FC_Tokyo	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tokyo_International_Film_Festival	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tokyo_Stock_Exchange	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tokyo_Metropolitan_Television	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tokyo_Disneyland	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Adachi,_Tokyo
Boeing	989	995	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Boeing	Faulty repair work by The Boeing Company BA.N was a contributary cause to a Japan Air Lines Co Ltd JAPN.Y 747 crash on August 12, 1985, that killed 520 people, the final draft of a Ministry of Transport report says. There were only four survivors when the aircraft crashed into a mountain north of Tokyo. The report said inadequate inspection of the aircraft by Japanese inspectors after the repairs was another factor in the crash. The crew were cleared of any responsibility for the disaster. The report, which was sent on March 23 to the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board for comment, should be released in late May. Under an international convention the draft must be submitted for final comments to the relevant authorities. Boeing spokesmen were unavailable for comment. On April 4, a Boeing spokesman at the firms headquarters said the company would probably make no comment on the Japanese investigation teams report until it was officially released. On September 6, 1985, Boeing said in a statement that the 1978 repairs it had undertaken were faulty. This statement did not, however, connect the faulty repairs with the cause of the crash.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Boeing_737	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Boeing_727	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Boeing_747	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Boeing_707	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Boeing_757	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Boeing_767	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Boeing_777	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Boeing_737_Classic	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Boeing_B-17_Flying_Fortress	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Boeing_B-29_Superfortress	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Boeing_747-400	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Boeing_737_Next_Generation	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Boeing_B-52_Stratofortress	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Boeing_CH-47_Chinook	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Boeing_787_Dreamliner	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Boeing_KC-135_Stratotanker	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Boeing_Field	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Boeing_717	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Boeing_720	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Boeing_B-47_Stratojet
DD	3589	3591	http://dbpedia.org/resource/DuPont	Cheap oil feedstocks, the weakened U.S. dollar and a plant utilization rate approaching 90 pct will propel the streamlined U.S. petrochemical industry to record profits this year, with growth expected through at least 1990, major company executives predicted. This bullish outlook for chemical manufacturing and an industrywide move to shed unrelated businesses has prompted GAF Corp (GAF), privately-held Cain Chemical Inc, and other firms to aggressively seek acquisitions of petrochemical plants. Oil companies such as Ashland Oil Inc (ASH), the Kentucky-based oil refiner and marketer, are also shopping for money-making petrochemical businesses to buy. I see us poised at the threshold of a golden period, said Paul Oreffice, chairman of giant Dow Chemical Co (DOW), adding, Theres no major plant capacity being added around the world now. The whole game is bringing out new products and improving the old ones. Analysts say the chemical industrys biggest customers, automobile manufacturers and home builders that use a lot of paints and plastics, are expected to buy quantities this year. U.S. petrochemical plants are currently operating at about 90 pct capacity, reflecting tighter supply that could hike product prices by 30 to 40 pct this year, said John Dosher, managing director of Pace Consultants Inc of Houston. Demand for some products such as styrene could push profit margins up by as much as 300 pct, he said. Oreffice, speaking at a meeting of chemical engineers in Houston, said Dow would easily top the 741 mln dlrs it earned last year and predicted it would have the best year in its history. In 1985, when oil prices were still above 25 dlrs a barrel and chemical exports were adversely affected by the strong U.S. dollar, Dow had profits of 58 mln dlrs. I believe the entire chemical industry is headed for a record year or close to it, Oreffice said. GAF chairman Samuel Heyman estimated that the U.S. chemical industry would report a 20 pct gain in profits during 1987. Last year, the domestic industry earned a total of 13 billion dlrs, a 54 pct leap from 1985. The turn in the fortunes of the once-sickly chemical industry has been brought about by a combination of luck and planning, said Paces John Dosher. Dosher said last years fall in oil prices made feedstocks dramatically cheaper and at the same time the American dollar was weakening against foreign currencies. That helped boost U.S. chemical exports. Also helping to bring supply and demand into balance has been the gradual market absorption of the extra chemical manufacturing capacity created by Middle Eastern oil producers in the early 1980s. Finally, virtually all major U.S. chemical manufacturers have embarked on an extensive corporate restructuring program to mothball inefficient plants, trim the payroll and eliminate unrelated businesses. The restructuring touched off a flurry of friendly and hostile takeover attempts. GAF, which made an unsuccessful attempt in 1985 to acquire Union Carbide Corp UK, recently offered three billion dlrs for Borg Warner Corp BOR, a Chicago manufacturer of plastics and chemicals. Another industry powerhouse, W.R. Grace (GRA) has divested its retailing, restaurant and fertilizer businesses to raise cash for chemical acquisitions. But some experts worry that the chemical industry may be headed for trouble if companies continue turning their back on the manufacturing of staple petrochemical commodities, such as ethylene, in favor of more profitable specialty chemicals that are custom-designed for a small group of buyers. Companies like DuPont (DD) and Monsanto Co MTC spent the past two or three years trying to get out of the commodity chemical business in reaction to how badly the market had deteriorated, Dosher said. But I think they will eventually kill the margins on the profitable chemicals in the niche market. Some top chemical executives share the concern. The challenge for our industry is to keep from getting carried away and repeating past mistakes, GAFs Heyman cautioned. The shift from commodity chemicals may be ill-advised. Specialty businesses do not stay special long. Houston-based Cain Chemical, created this month by the Sterling investment banking group, believes it can generate 700 mln dlrs in annual sales by bucking the industry trend. Chairman Gordon Cain, who previously led a leveraged buyout of Duponts Conoco Incs chemical business, has spent 1.1 billion dlrs since January to buy seven petrochemical plants along the Texas Gulf Coast. The plants produce only basic commodity petrochemicals that are the building blocks of specialty products. This kind of commodity chemical business will never be a glamorous, high-margin business, Cain said, adding that demand is expected to grow by about three pct annually. Garo Armen, an analyst with Dean Witter Reynolds, said chemical makers have also benefitted by increasing demand for plastics as prices become more competitive with aluminum, wood and steel products. Armen estimated the upturn in the chemical business could last as long as four or five years, provided the U.S. economy continues its modest rate of growth.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/USS_Duncan_(DD-485)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/USS_Gilmer_(DD-233)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/USS_The_Sullivans_(DD-537)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/USS_Fred_T._Berry_(DD-858)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/USS_Jouett_(DD-396)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/DD_Haryana	http://dbpedia.org/resource/USS_Wadsworth_(DD-60)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/USS_Edwards_(DD-265)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/USS_Bennett_(DD-473)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/USS_Laffey_(DD-459)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/USS_Owen_(DD-536)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/USS_John_R._Craig_(DD-885)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/USS_Welles_(DD-257)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/USS_Chew_(DD-106)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/USS_Manley_(DD-74)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/USS_Sigourney_(DD-643)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/USS_Dyess_(DD-880)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/USS_Monssen_(DD-798)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/JDS_Hatsuyuki_(DD-122)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/USS_Sampson_(DD-394)
Morgan	426	432	http://dbpedia.org/resource/J._P._Morgan	J.P. Morgan and Co Inc said its first-quarter earnings fell by 3.2 pct, largely reflecting its previously announced decision to place on non-accrual status its 1.3 billion dlrs of medium- and long-term loans to Brazil. That decision, spurred by Brazils suspension of interest payments on February 20, reduced the quarters net income by 20 mln dlrs to 226.4 mln dlrs, compared with 233.9 mln in the first three months of 1986. Morgan also reported a loss of 1.8 mln dlrs from securities underwriting and trading, in contrast to a gain of 45.4 mln dlrs in the year-earlier period. In the fourth quarter of 1986, Morgan posted other trading losses of 5.5 mln dlrs because of setbacks in the trading and underwriting of Euromarket securities. Conditions in some sectors of the Euromarket remained difficult last quarter, with floating rate notes suffering heavy price falls, but a spokeswoman was unable to say whether Morgans trading losses were restricted to the Euromarket. On the positive side, Morgan reduced its provision for loan losses to 35 mln dlrs from 70 mln a year earlier. Foreign exchange trading income rose to 82 mln dlrs from 72.6 mln and trust income increased to 95.9 mln dlrs from 75.9 mln. Morgan said other operating income, mainly fees and commissions, rose to 102.2 mln dlrs from 88.4 mln, but net investment securities gains dropped to 43.1 mln from 58.1 mln. Net interest earnings were 490.4 mln dlrs in the first quarter, down from 499.4 mln a year earlier, and net yield fell to 2.79 pct from 3.20 pct. If Brazil had not been placed on non-accrual, which means that interest can be recorded as income only when payments are actually received, net interest earnings would have been 525.9 mln dlrs and net yield 2.99 pct. If Brazil does not resume payments, 1987 net would be cut by 72 mln dlrs, Morgan added. After the provision for loan losses, Morgans allowance for credit losses at the end of March totaled 953 mln dlrs compared with 910 mln at end-1986 and 815 mln a year earlier. It reported net recoveries of six mln dlrs after charge-offs of eight mln, compared with net charge-offs of 49 mln dlrs after recoveries of three mln a year earlier. Excluding Brazil, non-accruing loans at quarters end were 583 mln dlrs, down from 633 mln at end-1986 and 684 mln a year earlier. Non-interest expenses rose to 371.1 mln dlrs from 303.5 mln dlrs, with more than half the increase related to personnel costs, Morgan said.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Morgan_Stanley	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Morgan_Freeman	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Morgan_Tsvangirai	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Morgan_State_University	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Lee_Morgan	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Morgan_County,_Indiana	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Piers_Morgan	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Harry_Morgan	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Morgan_City,_Louisiana	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Michèle_Morgan	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tracy_Morgan	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Morgan_County,_Ohio	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Robin_Morgan	http://dbpedia.org/resource/John_Hunt_Morgan	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Lorrie_Morgan	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Morgan_Spurlock	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Frank_Morgan	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Henry_Morgan	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Morgan_Studios	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Reuben_Morgan
Misiones	727	735	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Misiones_Province	Argentine grain producers adjusted their yield estimates for the 1986/87 coarse grain crop downward in the week to yesterday after the heavy rains at the end of March and beginning of April, trade sources said. They said sunflower, maize and sorghum production estimates had been reduced despite some later warm, dry weather, which has allowed a return to harvesting in some areas. However, as showers fell intermittently after last weekend, producers feared another spell of prolonged and intense rain could cause more damage to crops already badly hit this season. Rains in the middle of last week reached an average of 27 millimetres in parts of Buenos Aires province, 83 mm in Cordoba, 41 in Santa Fe, 50 in Entre Rios and Misiones, 95 in Corrientes, eight in Chaco and 35 in Formosa. There was no rainfall in the same period in La Pampa. Producers feared continued damp conditions could produce rotting and lead to still lower yield estimates for all the crops, including soybean. However, as the lands began drying later in the week harvesting advanced considerably, reaching between 36 and 40 pct of the area sown in the case of sunflower. Deterioration of the sunflower crop evident in harvested material in Cordoba, La Pampa and Buenos Aires forced yield estimates per hectare to be adjusted down again. The seasons sunflowerseed production is now forecast at 2.1 mln to 2.3 mln tonnes, against 2.2 mln to 2.4 mln forecast last week and down 43.9 to 48.8 pct on the 1985/86 record of 4.1 mln. Area sown to sunflowers was two to 2.2 mln hectares, 29.9 to 36.3 pct below the record 3.14 mln hectares last season. Maize harvesting has also reached 36 to 40 pct of the area sown. It is near completion in Cordoba and Santa Fe and will begin in La Pampa and southern Buenos Aires later in April. Production estimates for maize were down from last week at 9.5 mln to 9.8 mln tonnes, against 9.6 mln to 9.9 mln estimated previously. This is 22.2 to 23.4 pct below the 12.4 mln to 12.6 mln tonnes estimated by private sources for the 1985/86 crop and 21.9 to 25.8 pct down on the official figure of 12.8 mln tonnes. Maize was sown on 3.58 mln to 3.78 mln hectares, two to seven pct down on last seasons 3.85 mln. Sorghum was harvested on 23 to 25 pct of the area sown in Cordoba, Santa Fe and Chaco. Harvest will start in La Pampa and Buenos Aires in mid-April. The total area sown was 1.23 mln to 1.30 mln hectares, 10.3 to 15.2 pct down on the 1.45 mln sown last season. The new forecast for the sorghum crop is 2.9 mln to 3.2 mln tonnes compared with three mln to 3.3 mln forecast last week, and is 23.8 to 29.3 pct down on last seasons 4.1 mln to 4.2 mln tonne crop. The soybean crop for this season was not adjusted, remaining at a record 7.5 mln to 7.7 mln tonnes, up 4.2 to 5.5 pct on the 7.2 mln to 7.3 mln estimated by private sources for 1985/86 and 5.6 to 8.5 pct higher than the official figure of 7.1 mln. The area sown to soybeans this season was a record 3.7 mln to 3.8 mln hectares, 10.8 to 13.8 pct up on the record 3.34 mln sown in 1985/86. The soybean crop is showing excessive moisture in some areas and producers fear they may discover more damage. Some experimental harvesting was carried out in Santa Fe on areas making up only about one pct of the total crop but details on this were not available. Preparation of the fields for the 1987/88 wheat crop, which will be sown between May and August or September, has so far not been as intense as in previous years.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Miramar_Misiones	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Posadas,_Misiones	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Misiones_Department	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Eldorado,_Misiones	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Misiones_Orientales	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Candelaria_(Misiones)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/San_Antonio,_Misiones	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Misiones_Open	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bernardo_de_Irigoyen,_Misiones	http://dbpedia.org/resource/National_University_of_Misiones	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Montecarlo,_Misiones	http://dbpedia.org/resource/San_Ignacio,_Misiones	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Guaraní,_Misiones	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Loreto,_Misiones	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Misiones_Online	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Puerto_Rico_(Misiones)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/San_José,_Misiones	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Aristóbulo_del_Valle_(Misiones)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Corpus,_Misiones	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Almafuerte_(Misiones)

Officials seen arriving by Reuter correspondents included West German Finance Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg and Bundesbank President Karl Otto Poehl, French Finance Minister Edouard Balladur and his central banker Jacques de Larosiere. Also seen arriving were Japanese Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa and Japans central bank governor Satoshi Sumita and British Chancellor of the Exchequer and central bank governor Robin Leigh Pemberton. There was no immediate sign of Italian or Canadian officials. Monetary sources have said a fully blown meeting of the Group of Seven is expected to begin around 3 p.m. local time (1900 gmt) and last at least until 6 p.m. (2200 gmt), when a communique is expected to be issued. Italian sources said Italian acting Finance Minister Giovanni Goria met Treasury Secretary James Baker last night. At those talks Baker apparently convinced Goria, who declined to attend the February meeting of the Group of Seven in Paris, that Italy would participate fully in any meaningful decisions.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Provinces_of_Iran	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Counties_of_Iran	http://dbpedia.org/resource/National_Register_of_Historic_Places	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Departments_of_France	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Communes_of_France	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Voivodeships_of_Poland	http://dbpedia.org/resource/List_of_sovereign_states	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Political_divisions_of_the_United_States	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Administrative_divisions_of_Azerbaijan	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Republic_of_Ireland	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Provinces_of_Turkey	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Regions_of_France	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bachelor_of_Arts	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Municipalities_of_Slovenia	http://dbpedia.org/resource/States_of_Brazil	http://dbpedia.org/resource/University_of_Michigan	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Statistical_regions_of_Slovenia	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Provinces_of_Spain	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Counties_of_Estonia	http://dbpedia.org/resource/List_of_enzymes
Lawton Chiles	145	158	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Lawton_Chiles	The U.S. Senate Budget Committee ended its stalemate over a budget plan and approved by a single vote a revised 1988 budget proposed by chairman Lawton Chiles to cut the deficit to 133.7 billion next year. The new plan broke last week to cut the deficit to 133.7 billion next year. The new plan broke last week's gridlock in which the committee failed to approve a similar Chiles plan on a tie vote. Today, the measure was sent to the Senate 13 to 11. Among a series of changes to get the extra vote, Chiles added about 400 mln dlrs for additional, unspecified, agricultural spending programs to be paid with partly with higher user fees.

Japan	133	138	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Japan	Britain intends to negotiate further agreements on international securities regulation to match those now in force with the U.S. And Japan, government sources said. The Department of Trade and Industry said earlier it had concluded a memorandum of understanding with Japans Finance Ministry to swap supervisory and investigatory information. The agreement covers stocks, shares and government bonds, but not commodity futures, whose regulation in Japan does not come under the Finance Ministry. It therefore does not cover some transactions on the London International Financial Futures Exchange and the London commodities and metal exchanges. The DTI said it hoped to seek further understandings with other countries which met in the U.K. Last December. The meeting involved delegates from the U.K., Switzerland, the U.S., Canada, Australia, Hong Kong, Japan, France, West Germany and Holland. Government sources said the deal with Japan completes arrangements linking Tokyo, the U.S. And London. A U.K. Agreement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) was signed last September. Todays agreement will deal with requests for information on a case by case basis, U.K. Government sources said. It is not legally binding and comes into force immediately.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/East_Japan_Railway_Company	http://dbpedia.org/resource/West_Japan_Railway_Company	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Empire_of_Japan	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Japan_Football_League	http://dbpedia.org/resource/List_of_towns_in_Japan	http://dbpedia.org/resource/National_highways_of_Japan	http://dbpedia.org/resource/List_of_railway_stations_in_Japan	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Districts_of_Japan	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Liberal_Democratic_Party_(Japan)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Municipalities_of_Japan	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cinema_of_Japan	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Japan_national_football_team	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Japan_Hot_100	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sea_of_Japan	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Prefectures_of_Japan	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Central_Japan_Railway_Company	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Japan_Standard_Time	http://dbpedia.org/resource/King_Records_(Japan)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cities_of_Japan	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Surrender_of_Japan
Dominion	588	596	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dominion_Textile	The largest U.S. textile maker focused on its own business as its competitors found merger partners, but now Burlington Industries Inc may have restructured itself into an attractive takeover candidate, analysts said. The takeover spotlight fell today on Burlington, which rose 4-7/8 to 52-7/8 on speculation that investor Asher Edelman and Dominion Textiles Inc of Canada bought an almost five pct stake. A published report said Edelman and Dominion jointly acquired a stake in Burlington and were weighing a takeover offer. Edelman would not comment, and a spokesman for Montreal-based Dominion called the report just rumors. Burlington said it did not know if the report was true. Wall Street professionals said they were not convinced of the story or that Edelman and Dominion would be the victors if Burlington actually came into play. Arbitragers said past comments from Dominion, however, added credence to the speculation. Dominion has said that it was looking for a takeover in the U.S. Last year, Dominion unsuccessfully bid for Avondale Mills and has maintained a 120 mln dlr line of credit to be used for a U.S. acquisition. A Dominion spokesman said Canadas largest textile producer has been negotiating with many U.S. textile companies, but would not say whether Burlington was among them. There have been acquisitions in this area. Its not unusual that someone could be looking at Burlington after the housecleaning theyve done, said Eileen Gormley of Thomson McKinnon. Burlington sold its domestic operations, which made sheets and other linens, to J.P. Stevens and Co Inc for 110 mln dlrs last year. It also has reorganized management, and focused its operations on businesses that would be less affected by foreign competition, Gormley said. Theyve pulled back so as not to be a commodity marketer, said Gormley. She said in moving more heavily into industrial fabrics, Burlington bought C.H. Masland, which supplies carpets and other fabric to the auto industry. In the past, they just spent and never realized the return on the outlays they did make, she said. You look at their record over the year, and I think theyre poised to be more profitable than they had been in the past, Gormley said. She estimated 1987 earnings of 2.50 dlrs per share, up from 2.01 dlrs per share. Some analysts today recommended clients not buy Burlington at its current levels. Edward Johnson of Johnson Redbook said he recommends selling. He said he believes the stock is worth only about 50 dlrs on a takeover basis and about 46 dlrs on an earnings basis. Some arbitragers, however, said takeover values have been placed on the company of 60 to 65 dlrs per share. After Ashers (Edelman) recent history, a lot of people dont find him very credible anymore, said one arbitrager. Another, however, said Edelman succeeds in forcing managements to take steps to enhance shareholder values even if he doesnt win the target company. Edelman was unsuccessful last year in offers for Lucky Stores Inc and Fruehauf Corp. He did succeed in buying Ponderosa Inc. The stocks of other textile makers rose along with Burlington. J.P. Stevens STN climbed 5/8 to 44-7/8, and Fieldcrest Cannon Inc FLD, the result of a merger of Fieldcrest and Cannon, rose 1-1/8 to 39-3/4. West Point-Pepperell Inc WPM rose 1-7/8 to 67-1/8.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dominion	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dominion_of_Newfoundland	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Old_Dominion_University	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Kings_Dominion	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dominion_of_Ceylon	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dominion_of_Pakistan	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dominion_of_India	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dominion_Lands_Act	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Toronto-Dominion_Bank	http://dbpedia.org/resource/The_Dominion_Post_(Wellington)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dominion_Range	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dominion_Land_Survey	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dominion_Resources	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dominion_Theatre	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dominion_Atlantic_Railway	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Inter_Dominion	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dominion_Enterprises	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dominion_(Star_Trek)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dominion_Astrophysical_Observatory	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dominion_of_New_England
Rio Grande do Sul	630	647	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Rio_Grande_do_Sul	Storage problems with Brazils record grain crop are likely to result in losses of about five mln tonnes, an Agriculture Ministry spokesman said. Ministry spokesman Leonardo Brito, speaking from Brasilia, told Reuters he believed that about five mln tonnes of this years estimated crop of 65 mln tonnes would be lost. He said part of this would be the normal loss inevitable in harvesting, but that most of it would stem from storage problems. Brazil has a storage capacity of 66 mln tonnes, theoretically sufficient for the crop. But Brito said that the storage capacity was badly distributed. The states of Sao Paulo, Parana and Rio Grande do Sul had between them 70 pct of the nations capacity, but were responsible for only 50 to 60 pct of production. The biggest problems are concentrated in the Centre-West growing regions, where rising production has outpaced storage capacity. Brito said the Centre-West, whose crops include soya and maize, had between 30 and 40 pct of the nations grains production but only 20 pct of its storage space. In addition to the poor distribution of storage units, there is the problem that too much of the capacity is geared to storing grain in sacks, while not enough is suitable for storing loose grain, Brito said. Finally, there is a shortage of lorries to transport the crops. The sheer scale of the task in transporting the record crop has been evident from television reports, which have shown enormous queues of lorries waiting outside granaries.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Rio_de_Janeiro	http://dbpedia.org/resource/DOS	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Rio_Grande	http://dbpedia.org/resource/MS-DOS	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Rio_de_Janeiro_(state)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Rio_Grande_do_Norte	http://dbpedia.org/resource/List_of_municipalities_in_Rio_Grande_do_Sul	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mato_Grosso_do_Sul	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Grande_Comore	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Copa_do_Brasil	http://dbpedia.org/resource/List_of_rivers_of_Rio_Grande_do_Sul	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Rio_Grande_Valley	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Natal,_Rio_Grande_do_Norte	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Clube_de_Regatas_do_Flamengo	http://dbpedia.org/resource/São_Caetano_do_Sul	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sport_Club_do_Recife	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Angra_do_Heroísmo	http://dbpedia.org/resource/List_of_municipalities_in_Rio_Grande_do_Norte	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Rio_Tinto_Group	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ariana_Grande
Cetus Corp	335	345	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cetus_Corporation	Promising new findings in the use of a controversial experimental drug called Interleukin-2 as a cure for cancer will be published in the April 9 issue of the prestigious New England Journal of Medicine, according to a Wall Street analyst who has obtained an advance copy of the magazine. Among interleukins principal U. S. makers are Cetus Corp CTUS, headquartered in Emeryville, Calif., and Immunex Corp IMNX, based in Seattle, Wash. The journal, to be released late today, contains two articles reporting high remission rates several cancer types. The journal also contains a signed editorial concluding that the new results mark a significant milestone in the search for a successful immunotherapy for cancer. Interleukin-2, also known as IL-2, is a substance naturally produced by living cells in the laboratory. The drug is controversial because it was widely praised as a promising cancer treatment in early reports on its effectiveness in late 1985, only to come under criticism a year later for its failure to live up to its promise and due to its ravaging side effects. One of the new studies, conducted by Dr. William West of Biotherapeutics Inc of Franklin, Tenn., is particularly significant because it found far fewer harsh side effects after it changed the way in which the drug is administered. In that study, researchers administered IL-2 to 48 cancer patients and found a 50-pct remission rate for kidney cancers and a 50 pct remission rate for melanoma, a type of skin cancer, according to Prudential-Bache Securities Stuart Weisbrod, who obtained the advance copy of the magazine. For rectal and colon cancer, the researchers found no remissions, but none of the 48 patients treated had side effects serious enough to be placed under intensive hospital care, according to the article. In the second study, whose principal author is Dr. Steven Rosenberg of the National Cancer Institute, researchers administered IL-2 to 157 cancer patients and found a 33 pct remission rate in cancers of the kidney, a 27 pct rate in melanomas and a 15 pct rate in cancers of the colon and rectum. In the National Cancer Institute trials, a total of four patients died, the magazine reported, confirming the harshness of the drugs side effects as originally administered. Perhaps we are at the end of the beginning of the search for successful immunotherapy for cancer, said the editorial, signed by John Durant of Philadelphias Chase Cancer Center. These observations reported by Rosenberg and West surely did not describe successful practical approaches ready for widespread applications in the therapy of cancer patients, the editorial said. On the other hand, if they reflect, as seems possible, a successful manipulation of the cellular immune system, then we may be near the end of our search for a meaningful direction in the immunuotherapy of cancer, the editorial concluded.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cetus	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cetus_(mythology)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cetus_Dwarf	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Oopsidius_cetus	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cetus_Hill	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pisces–Cetus_Supercluster_Complex	http://dbpedia.org/resource/List_of_stars_in_Cetus	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cetus_(Chinese_astronomy)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/USS_Cetus_(AK-77)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Isle_of_Man_Civil_Defence_Corps	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pacific_Bearing_Corp	http://dbpedia.org/resource/French_ship_Six_Corps_(1762)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/X_Corps_(United_Kingdom)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Spy_Corps	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Empress_Casino_Joliet_Corp._v._Giannoulias	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Marine_Corps_Planning_Process	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Math_Science_Teaching_Corps	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Entergy_Corp._v._Riverkeeper_Inc.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/XIX_Corps	http://dbpedia.org/resource/United_States_Navy_Dental_Corps
DOW	766	769	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dow_Chemical_Company	Cheap oil feedstocks, the weakened U.S. dollar and a plant utilization rate approaching 90 pct will propel the streamlined U.S. petrochemical industry to record profits this year, with growth expected through at least 1990, major company executives predicted. This bullish outlook for chemical manufacturing and an industrywide move to shed unrelated businesses has prompted GAF Corp (GAF), privately-held Cain Chemical Inc, and other firms to aggressively seek acquisitions of petrochemical plants. Oil companies such as Ashland Oil Inc (ASH), the Kentucky-based oil refiner and marketer, are also shopping for money-making petrochemical businesses to buy. I see us poised at the threshold of a golden period, said Paul Oreffice, chairman of giant Dow Chemical Co (DOW), adding, Theres no major plant capacity being added around the world now. The whole game is bringing out new products and improving the old ones. Analysts say the chemical industrys biggest customers, automobile manufacturers and home builders that use a lot of paints and plastics, are expected to buy quantities this year. U.S. petrochemical plants are currently operating at about 90 pct capacity, reflecting tighter supply that could hike product prices by 30 to 40 pct this year, said John Dosher, managing director of Pace Consultants Inc of Houston. Demand for some products such as styrene could push profit margins up by as much as 300 pct, he said. Oreffice, speaking at a meeting of chemical engineers in Houston, said Dow would easily top the 741 mln dlrs it earned last year and predicted it would have the best year in its history. In 1985, when oil prices were still above 25 dlrs a barrel and chemical exports were adversely affected by the strong U.S. dollar, Dow had profits of 58 mln dlrs. I believe the entire chemical industry is headed for a record year or close to it, Oreffice said. GAF chairman Samuel Heyman estimated that the U.S. chemical industry would report a 20 pct gain in profits during 1987. Last year, the domestic industry earned a total of 13 billion dlrs, a 54 pct leap from 1985. The turn in the fortunes of the once-sickly chemical industry has been brought about by a combination of luck and planning, said Paces John Dosher. Dosher said last years fall in oil prices made feedstocks dramatically cheaper and at the same time the American dollar was weakening against foreign currencies. That helped boost U.S. chemical exports. Also helping to bring supply and demand into balance has been the gradual market absorption of the extra chemical manufacturing capacity created by Middle Eastern oil producers in the early 1980s. Finally, virtually all major U.S. chemical manufacturers have embarked on an extensive corporate restructuring program to mothball inefficient plants, trim the payroll and eliminate unrelated businesses. The restructuring touched off a flurry of friendly and hostile takeover attempts. GAF, which made an unsuccessful attempt in 1985 to acquire Union Carbide Corp UK, recently offered three billion dlrs for Borg Warner Corp BOR, a Chicago manufacturer of plastics and chemicals. Another industry powerhouse, W.R. Grace (GRA) has divested its retailing, restaurant and fertilizer businesses to raise cash for chemical acquisitions. But some experts worry that the chemical industry may be headed for trouble if companies continue turning their back on the manufacturing of staple petrochemical commodities, such as ethylene, in favor of more profitable specialty chemicals that are custom-designed for a small group of buyers. Companies like DuPont (DD) and Monsanto Co MTC spent the past two or three years trying to get out of the commodity chemical business in reaction to how badly the market had deteriorated, Dosher said. But I think they will eventually kill the margins on the profitable chemicals in the niche market. Some top chemical executives share the concern. The challenge for our industry is to keep from getting carried away and repeating past mistakes, GAFs Heyman cautioned. The shift from commodity chemicals may be ill-advised. Specialty businesses do not stay special long. Houston-based Cain Chemical, created this month by the Sterling investment banking group, believes it can generate 700 mln dlrs in annual sales by bucking the industry trend. Chairman Gordon Cain, who previously led a leveraged buyout of Duponts Conoco Incs chemical business, has spent 1.1 billion dlrs since January to buy seven petrochemical plants along the Texas Gulf Coast. The plants produce only basic commodity petrochemicals that are the building blocks of specialty products. This kind of commodity chemical business will never be a glamorous, high-margin business, Cain said, adding that demand is expected to grow by about three pct annually. Garo Armen, an analyst with Dean Witter Reynolds, said chemical makers have also benefitted by increasing demand for plastics as prices become more competitive with aluminum, wood and steel products. Armen estimated the upturn in the chemical business could last as long as four or five years, provided the U.S. economy continues its modest rate of growth.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dow_Jones_&_Company	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dow_Jones_Industrial_Average	http://dbpedia.org/resource/John_Dow_Fisher_Gilchrist	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dow_Corning	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dow_Finsterwald	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tony_Dow	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dow_AgroSciences	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dow_Medical_College	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Arthur_Wesley_Dow	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Alden_B._Dow	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Marion_Merrell_Dow	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dow_Event_Center	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mike_Dow	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dow_Constantine	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bill_Dow	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hugh_Dow	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Willie_Dow	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Charles_Dow	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Neal_Dow	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dow_Crag

DuPont	3581	3587	http://dbpedia.org/resource/DuPont	Cheap oil feedstocks, the weakened U.S. dollar and a plant utilization rate approaching 90 pct will propel the streamlined U.S. petrochemical industry to record profits this year, with growth expected through at least 1990, major company executives predicted. This bullish outlook for chemical manufacturing and an industrywide move to shed unrelated businesses has prompted GAF Corp (GAF), privately-held Cain Chemical Inc, and other firms to aggressively seek acquisitions of petrochemical plants. Oil companies such as Ashland Oil Inc (ASH), the Kentucky-based oil refiner and marketer, are also shopping for money-making petrochemical businesses to buy. I see us poised at the threshold of a golden period, said Paul Oreffice, chairman of giant Dow Chemical Co (DOW), adding, Theres no major plant capacity being added around the world now. The whole game is bringing out new products and improving the old ones. Analysts say the chemical industrys biggest customers, automobile manufacturers and home builders that use a lot of paints and plastics, are expected to buy quantities this year. U.S. petrochemical plants are currently operating at about 90 pct capacity, reflecting tighter supply that could hike product prices by 30 to 40 pct this year, said John Dosher, managing director of Pace Consultants Inc of Houston. Demand for some products such as styrene could push profit margins up by as much as 300 pct, he said. Oreffice, speaking at a meeting of chemical engineers in Houston, said Dow would easily top the 741 mln dlrs it earned last year and predicted it would have the best year in its history. In 1985, when oil prices were still above 25 dlrs a barrel and chemical exports were adversely affected by the strong U.S. dollar, Dow had profits of 58 mln dlrs. I believe the entire chemical industry is headed for a record year or close to it, Oreffice said. GAF chairman Samuel Heyman estimated that the U.S. chemical industry would report a 20 pct gain in profits during 1987. Last year, the domestic industry earned a total of 13 billion dlrs, a 54 pct leap from 1985. The turn in the fortunes of the once-sickly chemical industry has been brought about by a combination of luck and planning, said Paces John Dosher. Dosher said last years fall in oil prices made feedstocks dramatically cheaper and at the same time the American dollar was weakening against foreign currencies. That helped boost U.S. chemical exports. Also helping to bring supply and demand into balance has been the gradual market absorption of the extra chemical manufacturing capacity created by Middle Eastern oil producers in the early 1980s. Finally, virtually all major U.S. chemical manufacturers have embarked on an extensive corporate restructuring program to mothball inefficient plants, trim the payroll and eliminate unrelated businesses. The restructuring touched off a flurry of friendly and hostile takeover attempts. GAF, which made an unsuccessful attempt in 1985 to acquire Union Carbide Corp UK, recently offered three billion dlrs for Borg Warner Corp BOR, a Chicago manufacturer of plastics and chemicals. Another industry powerhouse, W.R. Grace (GRA) has divested its retailing, restaurant and fertilizer businesses to raise cash for chemical acquisitions. But some experts worry that the chemical industry may be headed for trouble if companies continue turning their back on the manufacturing of staple petrochemical commodities, such as ethylene, in favor of more profitable specialty chemicals that are custom-designed for a small group of buyers. Companies like DuPont (DD) and Monsanto Co MTC spent the past two or three years trying to get out of the commodity chemical business in reaction to how badly the market had deteriorated, Dosher said. But I think they will eventually kill the margins on the profitable chemicals in the niche market. Some top chemical executives share the concern. The challenge for our industry is to keep from getting carried away and repeating past mistakes, GAFs Heyman cautioned. The shift from commodity chemicals may be ill-advised. Specialty businesses do not stay special long. Houston-based Cain Chemical, created this month by the Sterling investment banking group, believes it can generate 700 mln dlrs in annual sales by bucking the industry trend. Chairman Gordon Cain, who previously led a leveraged buyout of Duponts Conoco Incs chemical business, has spent 1.1 billion dlrs since January to buy seven petrochemical plants along the Texas Gulf Coast. The plants produce only basic commodity petrochemicals that are the building blocks of specialty products. This kind of commodity chemical business will never be a glamorous, high-margin business, Cain said, adding that demand is expected to grow by about three pct annually. Garo Armen, an analyst with Dean Witter Reynolds, said chemical makers have also benefitted by increasing demand for plastics as prices become more competitive with aluminum, wood and steel products. Armen estimated the upturn in the chemical business could last as long as four or five years, provided the U.S. economy continues its modest rate of growth.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dupont_Circle	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Margaret_Osborne_duPont	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Laura_duPont	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Clifford_Dupont	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Alfred_I._duPont–Columbia_University_Award	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Madeleine_Dupont	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Timothy_Dupont	http://dbpedia.org/resource/DuPont,_Washington	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Denise_Dupont	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dupont,_Pennsylvania	http://dbpedia.org/resource/DuPont_Manual_High_School	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tour_DuPont	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Leo_Dupont	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pernille_Dupont	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Charlie_Dupont	http://dbpedia.org/resource/DuPont_Central_Research	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Arthur_Dupont	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Miss_DuPont	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Fort_Dupont_Park	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Nicolas_Dupont-Aignan
Volkswagen AG	0	13	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Volkswagen_Group	Volkswagen AG VOWG.F, VW, is due to make a formal announcement about its 1986 dividend tomorrow after saying the 1985 level of 10 marks per ordinary share would be held, despite massive losses because of a suspected foreign currency fraud. A spokesman said VWs supervisory board will meet tomorrow to discuss the payout. A statement will be made afterwards. VW has also said disclosed profits for 1986 will reach their 1985 level, despite provisions of a possible 480 mln marks linked to the currency affair. The figure is virtually the same as the 477 mln mark 1985 parent company net profit. When VW first confirmed the currency scandal on March 10 it said the management board would propose an unchanged 10-mark dividend to the supervisory board. A dividend of 11 marks would be proposed for the companys new preference shares. Share analysts said they saw supervisory board approval of the management board proposal as virtually a formality. Anything else would be more than a surprise, one said. Company sources said VW would have to dig into reserves to maintain the disclosed profit. Parent company reserves stood at around three billion marks at end-1985.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Volkswagen	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Volkswagen_Beetle	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Volkswagen_Golf	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Volkswagen_air-cooled_engine	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Volkswagen_Polo	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Volkswagen_Passat	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Volkswagen_Jetta	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Volkswagen_Type_2	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Volkswagen_Scirocco	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Volkswagen_Touareg	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Volkswagen_New_Beetle	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Volkswagen_Motorsport	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Volkswagen_Transporter	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Volkswagen_Group_A_platform	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Volkswagen_Arena	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Volkswagen_LT	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Volkswagen_Caddy	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Volkswagen_Gol	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Volkswagen_Phaeton	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Volkswagen_Karmann_Ghia

Baker	973	978	http://dbpedia.org/resource/James_Baker	Top officials of leading industrial nations arrived at the U.S. Treasury main building to begin a meeting of the Group of Five. Officials seen arriving by Reuter correspondents included West German Finance Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg and Bundesbank President Karl Otto Poehl, French Finance Minister Edouard Balladur and his central banker Jacques de Larosiere. Also seen arriving were Japanese Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa and Japans central bank governor Satoshi Sumita and British Chancellor of the Exchequer and central bank governor Robin Leigh Pemberton. There was no immediate sign of Italian or Canadian officials. Monetary sources have said a fully blown meeting of the Group of Seven is expected to begin around 3 p.m. local time (1900 gmt) and last at least until 6 p.m. (2200 gmt), when a communique is expected to be issued. Italian sources said Italian acting Finance Minister Giovanni Goria met Treasury Secretary James Baker last night.

Georgia Power	1209	1222	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Georgia_Power	An audit submitted to the Georgia Public Service Commission claims that between 944 mln dlrs and 1.8 billion dlrs of the costs of the Plant Vogtle nuclear power station should be disallowed, a Southern Co spokeswoman said. Southerns Georgia Power Co subsidiary has a 45.7 pct interest in the plant and estimated earlier this year it would cost a total of 8.87 billion dlrs. Last year, the plants owners pledged to Georgia regulators they would limit the cost passed on to rate payers to 8.4 billion dlrs. The Southern spokeswoman said the company feels the report by OBrien-Kreitzberg is flawed and biased. She said the report was released yesterday by the state attorney general. Responding to the report today, Georgia Power Chairman Robert W. Scherer told a news conference the conclusions drawn by the firm are not only wrong -- they also reflect the same bias against nuclear power that these auditors have demonstrated in similar cases accross the country. Saying he was not suggesting Georgia power was without fault, Scherer said the audit identified several things I wish we had done differently. Scherer pointed out a report OBrien-Kreitzberg submitted to Georgia regulators in March 1986 projected Georgia Power would not finish Plant Vogtle unit one before the end of 1987. Noting unit one is finished, and we expect it to be in commercial operationg by June, he said the firms latest report ignored the earlier projection, gave the utility no credit for the completion and actually penalized us by suggesting that costs to maintain t he schedule be disallowed. Scherer said the latest audit alleges Georgia Power could have saved 95 mln dlrs if it had stopped using four shifts, seven days a week to speed construction three years sooner. He said this would have delayed completion of the plant for another year and it would have cost several hunderd million dlrs more. Noting the audit said costs were increased 600 mln dlrs by schedule delays totaling 20.5 months, he said First, we have the best concrete placement record in the industry, Second new government regulations after the Three Mile Island incident significantly increased construction time.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Georgia_(country)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Georgia_(U.S._state)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Power_metal	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Savannah,_Georgia	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Power_pop	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Power_forward_(basketball)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/University_of_Georgia	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Athens,_Georgia	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Macon,_Georgia	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Augusta,_Georgia	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Columbus,_Georgia	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Nuclear_power	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Power_station	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Georgia_Institute_of_Technology	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Solar_power	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Axis_powers	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Wind_power	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Marietta,_Georgia	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Electric_power	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Effective_radiated_power

Netherlands	560	571	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Netherlands	Roughly half of this years expected 130,000 hectare Dutch sugar beet crop is already in the ground, a spokesman for Suiker Unie, the largest sugar processor in the Netherlands, told Reuters. Conditions are generally good and the average sowing date for the crop is expected to be around April 11, against April 23 last year, and a 10-year average of April 14, the spokesman added. It is far too early yet to say what kind of output we can expect when it comes to harvest in September, but at least the crop is off to a very good start, he said. Last year, the Netherlands planted a record 137,600 hectares of sugar beet and produced a record 1.2 mln tonnes of white sugar, substantially more than the countrys combined A and B quota of 872,000 tonnes. This year, however, a self-imposed quota system has been introduced with the aim of cutting plantings to 130,000 hectares and reducing white sugar output to around 915,000 tonnes to minimise the amount of non-quota C sugar produced. Only farmers with a record of growing suger beet have been allotted quotas. This is expected to prevent the area being boosted by dairy or cereal farmers moving into sugar.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Limburg_(Netherlands)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Netherlands_Antilles	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Provinces_of_the_Netherlands	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Netherlands_national_football_team	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Telephone_numbers_in_the_Netherlands	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Royal_Netherlands_Navy	http://dbpedia.org/resource/List_of_municipalities_of_the_Netherlands	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Southern_Netherlands	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Emmen,_Netherlands	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Spanish_Netherlands	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Labour_Party_(Netherlands)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Kingdom_of_the_Netherlands	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Austrian_Netherlands	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Royal_Netherlands_Academy_of_Arts_and_Sciences	http://dbpedia.org/resource/House_of_Representatives_(Netherlands)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ede,_Netherlands	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Municipal_council_(Netherlands)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Senate_(Netherlands)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Netherlands_national_cricket_team	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Beatrix_of_the_Netherlands
Miller	670	676	http://dbpedia.org/resource/James_C._Miller_III	Office of Management and Budget Director James Miller said President Reagan will reject the tax increase called for in the House Budget Committees 1988 budget proposal which is before the House for a vote today. Its just completely unacceptable, Miller told a House Appropriations subcommittee on Treasury, Postal Service and General Government Appropriations. The plan, drafted by the Democratic-controlled Budget committee, calls for 22 billion dlrs in higher revenues, of which 18 billion would be from new taxes set by the tax-writing committees. The House committees budget proposal includes some increases in federal user fees as well as 18 billion dlrs in taxes. Miller warned that failure to reduce the federal deficit would jeopardize the U.S. economy. If we do not further reduce the deficit... we place this economic expansion that weve had in the last five years at risk, Miller told the subcommittee. The result of any kind of tax increase would be to increase substantially the prospects that the expansion would come to an end, Miller said.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Arthur_Miller	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Glenn_Miller	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Miller	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Marcus_Miller	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Henry_Miller	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Roger_Miller	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Philip_Miller	http://dbpedia.org/resource/P._Schuyler_Miller	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Barney_Miller	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Gerrit_Smith_Miller	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dennis_Miller	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mac_Miller	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ben_Millers	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Frank_Miller_(comics)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Minneapolis_Millers	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mitch_Miller	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Jonathan_Miller	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ernest_Miller_(cinematographer)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Steve_Miller_Band	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sienna_Miller
Burlington	1485	1495	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Burlington_Industries	The largest U.S. textile maker focused on its own business as its competitors found merger partners, but now Burlington Industries Inc may have restructured itself into an attractive takeover candidate, analysts said. The takeover spotlight fell today on Burlington, which rose 4-7/8 to 52-7/8 on speculation that investor Asher Edelman and Dominion Textiles Inc of Canada bought an almost five pct stake. A published report said Edelman and Dominion jointly acquired a stake in Burlington and were weighing a takeover offer. Edelman would not comment, and a spokesman for Montreal-based Dominion called the report just rumors. Burlington said it did not know if the report was true. Wall Street professionals said they were not convinced of the story or that Edelman and Dominion would be the victors if Burlington actually came into play. Arbitragers said past comments from Dominion, however, added credence to the speculation. Dominion has said that it was looking for a takeover in the U.S. Last year, Dominion unsuccessfully bid for Avondale Mills and has maintained a 120 mln dlr line of credit to be used for a U.S. acquisition. A Dominion spokesman said Canadas largest textile producer has been negotiating with many U.S. textile companies, but would not say whether Burlington was among them. There have been acquisitions in this area. Its not unusual that someone could be looking at Burlington after the housecleaning theyve done, said Eileen Gormley of Thomson McKinnon. Burlington sold its domestic operations, which made sheets and other linens, to J.P. Stevens and Co Inc for 110 mln dlrs last year. It also has reorganized management, and focused its operations on businesses that would be less affected by foreign competition, Gormley said. Theyve pulled back so as not to be a commodity marketer, said Gormley. She said in moving more heavily into industrial fabrics, Burlington bought C.H. Masland, which supplies carpets and other fabric to the auto industry. In the past, they just spent and never realized the return on the outlays they did make, she said. You look at their record over the year, and I think theyre poised to be more profitable than they had been in the past, Gormley said.

CME	585	588	http://dbpedia.org/resource/CME_Group	The Chicago Mercantile Exchange, CME, said it has added a new chief compliance officer and will expand its regulatory surveillance program. Paul OKelly, currently assistant regional administrator of the Securities and Exchange Commission, was named vice-president of compliance for the exchange, the CME said. The expanded compliance program, which calls for an increase in the exchanges compliance budget and addition of staff, was in response to recent criticisms that the CMEs current surveillance was not able to keep up with increased demands of recent volatility and volume, the CME said. The new surveillance program calls for the addition of three floor investigators and five compliance investigators, the CME said. Some of the new staff will monitor the exchanges new Computerized Trade Reconstruction system, scheduled to start July 1. In addition, three computer programmers will be added to assist in regulatory support for the exchanges management information system department. Recent criticism has been especially directed at the CMEs Standard and Poors stock index futures and options division. A special membership referendum to prohibit CME members from filling customer orders and trading for their own account in S and P 500 futures and options will be voted on April 13. In a letter dated March 12, CME chairman John Sandner and Executive committee chairman Leo Melamed urged members to reject the referendum in favor a series of new rules. Included in the rule changes was the requirement that futures brokers in the S and P pit manually record all personal trades to the nearest minute, intended to enhance the effectiveness of surveillance and compliance functions, We made a promise to our members that we have kept, Melamed said in a release today. He said the new surveillance program represents a commitment to a vigorous enforcement policy.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/CME_Group_Tour_Championship	http://dbpedia.org/resource/2013_CME_Group_Titleholders	http://dbpedia.org/resource/2015_CME_Group_Tour_Championship	http://dbpedia.org/resource/CME_SPAN	http://dbpedia.org/resource/2012_CME_Group_Titleholders	http://dbpedia.org/resource/2011_CME_Group_Titleholders	http://dbpedia.org/resource/2014_CME_Group_Tour_Championship	http://dbpedia.org/resource/2016_CME_Group_Tour_Championship	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Phillips_Chapel_CME_Church

Fieldcrest Cannon Inc	3160	3181	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cannon_Mills	The largest U.S. textile maker focused on its own business as its competitors found merger partners, but now Burlington Industries Inc may have restructured itself into an attractive takeover candidate, analysts said. The takeover spotlight fell today on Burlington, which rose 4-7/8 to 52-7/8 on speculation that investor Asher Edelman and Dominion Textiles Inc of Canada bought an almost five pct stake. A published report said Edelman and Dominion jointly acquired a stake in Burlington and were weighing a takeover offer. Edelman would not comment, and a spokesman for Montreal-based Dominion called the report just rumors. Burlington said it did not know if the report was true. Wall Street professionals said they were not convinced of the story or that Edelman and Dominion would be the victors if Burlington actually came into play. Arbitragers said past comments from Dominion, however, added credence to the speculation. Dominion has said that it was looking for a takeover in the U.S. Last year, Dominion unsuccessfully bid for Avondale Mills and has maintained a 120 mln dlr line of credit to be used for a U.S. acquisition. A Dominion spokesman said Canadas largest textile producer has been negotiating with many U.S. textile companies, but would not say whether Burlington was among them. There have been acquisitions in this area. Its not unusual that someone could be looking at Burlington after the housecleaning theyve done, said Eileen Gormley of Thomson McKinnon. Burlington sold its domestic operations, which made sheets and other linens, to J.P. Stevens and Co Inc for 110 mln dlrs last year. It also has reorganized management, and focused its operations on businesses that would be less affected by foreign competition, Gormley said. Theyve pulled back so as not to be a commodity marketer, said Gormley. She said in moving more heavily into industrial fabrics, Burlington bought C.H. Masland, which supplies carpets and other fabric to the auto industry. In the past, they just spent and never realized the return on the outlays they did make, she said. You look at their record over the year, and I think theyre poised to be more profitable than they had been in the past, Gormley said. She estimated 1987 earnings of 2.50 dlrs per share, up from 2.01 dlrs per share. Some analysts today recommended clients not buy Burlington at its current levels.

Holland	886	893	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Netherlands	Britain intends to negotiate further agreements on international securities regulation to match those now in force with the U.S. And Japan, government sources said. The Department of Trade and Industry said earlier it had concluded a memorandum of understanding with Japans Finance Ministry to swap supervisory and investigatory information. The agreement covers stocks, shares and government bonds, but not commodity futures, whose regulation in Japan does not come under the Finance Ministry. It therefore does not cover some transactions on the London International Financial Futures Exchange and the London commodities and metal exchanges. The DTI said it hoped to seek further understandings with other countries which met in the U.K. Last December. The meeting involved delegates from the U.K., Switzerland, the U.S., Canada, Australia, Hong Kong, Japan, France, West Germany and Holland. Government sources said the deal with Japan completes arrangements linking Tokyo, the U.S. And London. A U.K. Agreement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) was signed last September. Todays agreement will deal with requests for information on a case by case basis, U.K. Government sources said. It is not legally binding and comes into force immediately.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Stephen_Holland	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Van_de_Kamp's_Holland_Dutch_Bakeries	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Lawrence_Holland	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Theodore_Holland	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Holland_America_Line	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Rustenburg,_North_Holland	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Brian_Holland	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Schmidt_v_Holland	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Holland_Casino	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dave_Holland_(rugby)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Charles_A._Holland	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Springfield_High_School_(Holland,_Ohio)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Nieuwendijk,_South_Holland	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Flag_of_New_Holland	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Merlin_Holland	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Eddy_Hollands	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Stuart_Holland	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Holland_Park,_Queensland	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ed_Holland	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tom_Holland_(artist)
Reuters	182	189	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Reuters	Roughly half of this years expected 130,000 hectare Dutch sugar beet crop is already in the ground, a spokesman for Suiker Unie, the largest sugar processor in the Netherlands, told Reuters. Conditions are generally good and the average sowing date for the crop is expected to be around April 11, against April 23 last year, and a 10-year average of April 14, the spokesman added. It is far too early yet to say what kind of output we can expect when it comes to harvest in September, but at least the crop is off to a very good start, he said. Last year, the Netherlands planted a record 137,600 hectares of sugar beet and produced a record 1.2 mln tonnes of white sugar, substantially more than the countrys combined A and B quota of 872,000 tonnes. This year, however, a self-imposed quota system has been introduced with the aim of cutting plantings to 130,000 hectares and reducing white sugar output to around 915,000 tonnes to minimise the amount of non-quota C sugar produced. Only farmers with a record of growing suger beet have been allotted quotas. This is expected to prevent the area being boosted by dairy or cereal farmers moving into sugar.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thomson_Reuters	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Reuters_Group	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Reuters_3000_Xtra	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thomson_Reuters_Foundation	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thomson_Reuters_Indices	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thomson_Reuters_Citation_Laureates	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Reuters_Digital_Vision_Program	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Reuters_Institute_for_the_Study_of_Journalism	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thomson_Reuters_Business_Classification	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Reuters_TV	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Reuters_Insider	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Reuters_Market_Data_System	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Calais_(Reuters_product)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thomson_Reuters_Realized_Volatility_Index	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thomson_Reuters_Messenger	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Reuters_Market_Light	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Reuters_Instrument_Code	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thomson_Reuters_league_tables

Texas Gulf Coast	4498	4514	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Gulf_Coast_of_the_United_States	Cheap oil feedstocks, the weakened U.S. dollar and a plant utilization rate approaching 90 pct will propel the streamlined U.S. petrochemical industry to record profits this year, with growth expected through at least 1990, major company executives predicted. This bullish outlook for chemical manufacturing and an industrywide move to shed unrelated businesses has prompted GAF Corp (GAF), privately-held Cain Chemical Inc, and other firms to aggressively seek acquisitions of petrochemical plants. Oil companies such as Ashland Oil Inc (ASH), the Kentucky-based oil refiner and marketer, are also shopping for money-making petrochemical businesses to buy. I see us poised at the threshold of a golden period, said Paul Oreffice, chairman of giant Dow Chemical Co (DOW), adding, Theres no major plant capacity being added around the world now. The whole game is bringing out new products and improving the old ones. Analysts say the chemical industrys biggest customers, automobile manufacturers and home builders that use a lot of paints and plastics, are expected to buy quantities this year. U.S. petrochemical plants are currently operating at about 90 pct capacity, reflecting tighter supply that could hike product prices by 30 to 40 pct this year, said John Dosher, managing director of Pace Consultants Inc of Houston. Demand for some products such as styrene could push profit margins up by as much as 300 pct, he said. Oreffice, speaking at a meeting of chemical engineers in Houston, said Dow would easily top the 741 mln dlrs it earned last year and predicted it would have the best year in its history. In 1985, when oil prices were still above 25 dlrs a barrel and chemical exports were adversely affected by the strong U.S. dollar, Dow had profits of 58 mln dlrs. I believe the entire chemical industry is headed for a record year or close to it, Oreffice said. GAF chairman Samuel Heyman estimated that the U.S. chemical industry would report a 20 pct gain in profits during 1987. Last year, the domestic industry earned a total of 13 billion dlrs, a 54 pct leap from 1985. The turn in the fortunes of the once-sickly chemical industry has been brought about by a combination of luck and planning, said Paces John Dosher. Dosher said last years fall in oil prices made feedstocks dramatically cheaper and at the same time the American dollar was weakening against foreign currencies. That helped boost U.S. chemical exports. Also helping to bring supply and demand into balance has been the gradual market absorption of the extra chemical manufacturing capacity created by Middle Eastern oil producers in the early 1980s. Finally, virtually all major U.S. chemical manufacturers have embarked on an extensive corporate restructuring program to mothball inefficient plants, trim the payroll and eliminate unrelated businesses. The restructuring touched off a flurry of friendly and hostile takeover attempts. GAF, which made an unsuccessful attempt in 1985 to acquire Union Carbide Corp UK, recently offered three billion dlrs for Borg Warner Corp BOR, a Chicago manufacturer of plastics and chemicals. Another industry powerhouse, W.R. Grace (GRA) has divested its retailing, restaurant and fertilizer businesses to raise cash for chemical acquisitions. But some experts worry that the chemical industry may be headed for trouble if companies continue turning their back on the manufacturing of staple petrochemical commodities, such as ethylene, in favor of more profitable specialty chemicals that are custom-designed for a small group of buyers. Companies like DuPont (DD) and Monsanto Co MTC spent the past two or three years trying to get out of the commodity chemical business in reaction to how badly the market had deteriorated, Dosher said. But I think they will eventually kill the margins on the profitable chemicals in the niche market. Some top chemical executives share the concern. The challenge for our industry is to keep from getting carried away and repeating past mistakes, GAFs Heyman cautioned. The shift from commodity chemicals may be ill-advised. Specialty businesses do not stay special long. Houston-based Cain Chemical, created this month by the Sterling investment banking group, believes it can generate 700 mln dlrs in annual sales by bucking the industry trend. Chairman Gordon Cain, who previously led a leveraged buyout of Duponts Conoco Incs chemical business, has spent 1.1 billion dlrs since January to buy seven petrochemical plants along the Texas Gulf Coast. The plants produce only basic commodity petrochemicals that are the building blocks of specialty products. This kind of commodity chemical business will never be a glamorous, high-margin business, Cain said, adding that demand is expected to grow by about three pct annually. Garo Armen, an analyst with Dean Witter Reynolds, said chemical makers have also benefitted by increasing demand for plastics as prices become more competitive with aluminum, wood and steel products. Armen estimated the upturn in the chemical business could last as long as four or five years, provided the U.S. economy continues its modest rate of growth.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ivory_Coast	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Gulf_of_Mexico	http://dbpedia.org/resource/United_States_Coast_Guard	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Gulf_War	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Persian_Gulf	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Districts_of_Ivory_Coast	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Departments_of_Ivory_Coast	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Regions_of_Ivory_Coast	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Coast_Province	http://dbpedia.org/resource/West_Coast_of_the_United_States	http://dbpedia.org/resource/East_Coast_of_the_United_States	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Communes_of_Ivory_Coast	http://dbpedia.org/resource/University_of_Texas_at_Austin	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sub-prefectures_of_Ivory_Coast	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Wizards_of_the_Coast	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Atlantic_Coast_Conference	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Gulf_of_California	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Coast	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Gold_Coast,_Queensland	http://dbpedia.org/resource/List_of_counties_in_Texas
Reagan	303	309	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ronald_Reagan	A Treasury official said there are no plans to try to reduce the U.S. budget deficit by issuing yen-denominated bonds that would become known as Reagan bonds. It simply isnt something that we are planning to do, the official said. He added the Treasury was aware of Japanese news reports suggesting the Reagan administration might issue such bonds as the former Carter administration did when it sold Carter bonds denominated in West German marks. But he said the situation was greatly different now. If you look at the differences between the treasury market now and in the Carter administration years, it is a much more global market now, the official said. There was not the same ease then for the holder of another currency to buy other countries securities, he added, But there is no difficulty now for them to purchase dollars and buy U.S. securities. The United States needs dollars, not Japanese yen, to pay its debts and reduce the deficit and so has no plans to issue yen-denominated bonds, he emphasized.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Nancy_Reagan	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Presidency_of_Ronald_Reagan	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ronald_Reagan_Washington_National_Airport	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Reagan_Youth	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ronald_Reagan_Presidential_Library	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ronald_Reagan_UCLA_Medical_Center	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Michael_Reagan	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ron_Reagan	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Reagan_Doctrine	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Attempted_assassination_of_Ronald_Reagan	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Reagan_County,_Texas	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Maureen_Reagan	http://dbpedia.org/resource/List_of_federal_judges_appointed_by_Ronald_Reagan	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ronald_Reagan_in_music	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Reagan_Pasternak	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ronald_Reagan_filmography	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ronald_Reagan_Ballistic_Missile_Defense_Test_Site	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ronald_Reagan_Cross_County_Highway	http://dbpedia.org/resource/The_Reagans	http://dbpedia.org/resource/USS_Ronald_Reagan

CME	715	718	http://dbpedia.org/resource/CME_Group	The Chicago Mercantile Exchange, CME, said it has added a new chief compliance officer and will expand its regulatory surveillance program. Paul OKelly, currently assistant regional administrator of the Securities and Exchange Commission, was named vice-president of compliance for the exchange, the CME said. The expanded compliance program, which calls for an increase in the exchanges compliance budget and addition of staff, was in response to recent criticisms that the CMEs current surveillance was not able to keep up with increased demands of recent volatility and volume, the CME said. The new surveillance program calls for the addition of three floor investigators and five compliance investigators, the CME said. Some of the new staff will monitor the exchanges new Computerized Trade Reconstruction system, scheduled to start July 1. In addition, three computer programmers will be added to assist in regulatory support for the exchanges management information system department. Recent criticism has been especially directed at the CMEs Standard and Poors stock index futures and options division. A special membership referendum to prohibit CME members from filling customer orders and trading for their own account in S and P 500 futures and options will be voted on April 13. In a letter dated March 12, CME chairman John Sandner and Executive committee chairman Leo Melamed urged members to reject the referendum in favor a series of new rules. Included in the rule changes was the requirement that futures brokers in the S and P pit manually record all personal trades to the nearest minute, intended to enhance the effectiveness of surveillance and compliance functions, We made a promise to our members that we have kept, Melamed said in a release today. He said the new surveillance program represents a commitment to a vigorous enforcement policy.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/CME_Group_Tour_Championship	http://dbpedia.org/resource/2013_CME_Group_Titleholders	http://dbpedia.org/resource/2015_CME_Group_Tour_Championship	http://dbpedia.org/resource/CME_SPAN	http://dbpedia.org/resource/2012_CME_Group_Titleholders	http://dbpedia.org/resource/2011_CME_Group_Titleholders	http://dbpedia.org/resource/2014_CME_Group_Tour_Championship	http://dbpedia.org/resource/2016_CME_Group_Tour_Championship	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Phillips_Chapel_CME_Church
The Boeing Company	22	40	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Boeing	Faulty repair work by The Boeing Company BA.N was a contributary cause to a Japan Air Lines Co Ltd JAPN.Y 747 crash on August 12, 1985, that killed 520 people, the final draft of a Ministry of Transport report says. There were only four survivors when the aircraft crashed into a mountain north of Tokyo. The report said inadequate inspection of the aircraft by Japanese inspectors after the repairs was another factor in the crash. The crew were cleared of any responsibility for the disaster. The report, which was sent on March 23 to the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board for comment, should be released in late May. Under an international convention the draft must be submitted for final comments to the relevant authorities. Boeing spokesmen were unavailable for comment. On April 4, a Boeing spokesman at the firms headquarters said the company would probably make no comment on the Japanese investigation teams report until it was officially released. On September 6, 1985, Boeing said in a statement that the 1978 repairs it had undertaken were faulty. This statement did not, however, connect the faulty repairs with the cause of the crash.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Boeing_737	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Boeing_727	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Boeing_747	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Boeing_707	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Boeing_757	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Boeing_767	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Boeing_777	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Boeing_737_Classic	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Boeing_B-17_Flying_Fortress	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Boeing_B-29_Superfortress	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Boeing_747-400	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Boeing_737_Next_Generation	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Boeing_B-52_Stratofortress	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Boeing_CH-47_Chinook	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Boeing_787_Dreamliner	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Boeing_KC-135_Stratotanker	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Boeing_Field	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Boeing_717	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Boeing_720	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Boeing_B-47_Stratojet
Dean Witter Reynolds	4820	4840	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dean_Witter_Reynolds	Cheap oil feedstocks, the weakened U.S. dollar and a plant utilization rate approaching 90 pct will propel the streamlined U.S. petrochemical industry to record profits this year, with growth expected through at least 1990, major company executives predicted. This bullish outlook for chemical manufacturing and an industrywide move to shed unrelated businesses has prompted GAF Corp (GAF), privately-held Cain Chemical Inc, and other firms to aggressively seek acquisitions of petrochemical plants. Oil companies such as Ashland Oil Inc (ASH), the Kentucky-based oil refiner and marketer, are also shopping for money-making petrochemical businesses to buy. I see us poised at the threshold of a golden period, said Paul Oreffice, chairman of giant Dow Chemical Co (DOW), adding, Theres no major plant capacity being added around the world now. The whole game is bringing out new products and improving the old ones. Analysts say the chemical industrys biggest customers, automobile manufacturers and home builders that use a lot of paints and plastics, are expected to buy quantities this year. U.S. petrochemical plants are currently operating at about 90 pct capacity, reflecting tighter supply that could hike product prices by 30 to 40 pct this year, said John Dosher, managing director of Pace Consultants Inc of Houston. Demand for some products such as styrene could push profit margins up by as much as 300 pct, he said. Oreffice, speaking at a meeting of chemical engineers in Houston, said Dow would easily top the 741 mln dlrs it earned last year and predicted it would have the best year in its history. In 1985, when oil prices were still above 25 dlrs a barrel and chemical exports were adversely affected by the strong U.S. dollar, Dow had profits of 58 mln dlrs. I believe the entire chemical industry is headed for a record year or close to it, Oreffice said. GAF chairman Samuel Heyman estimated that the U.S. chemical industry would report a 20 pct gain in profits during 1987. Last year, the domestic industry earned a total of 13 billion dlrs, a 54 pct leap from 1985. The turn in the fortunes of the once-sickly chemical industry has been brought about by a combination of luck and planning, said Paces John Dosher. Dosher said last years fall in oil prices made feedstocks dramatically cheaper and at the same time the American dollar was weakening against foreign currencies. That helped boost U.S. chemical exports. Also helping to bring supply and demand into balance has been the gradual market absorption of the extra chemical manufacturing capacity created by Middle Eastern oil producers in the early 1980s. Finally, virtually all major U.S. chemical manufacturers have embarked on an extensive corporate restructuring program to mothball inefficient plants, trim the payroll and eliminate unrelated businesses. The restructuring touched off a flurry of friendly and hostile takeover attempts. GAF, which made an unsuccessful attempt in 1985 to acquire Union Carbide Corp UK, recently offered three billion dlrs for Borg Warner Corp BOR, a Chicago manufacturer of plastics and chemicals. Another industry powerhouse, W.R. Grace (GRA) has divested its retailing, restaurant and fertilizer businesses to raise cash for chemical acquisitions. But some experts worry that the chemical industry may be headed for trouble if companies continue turning their back on the manufacturing of staple petrochemical commodities, such as ethylene, in favor of more profitable specialty chemicals that are custom-designed for a small group of buyers. Companies like DuPont (DD) and Monsanto Co MTC spent the past two or three years trying to get out of the commodity chemical business in reaction to how badly the market had deteriorated, Dosher said. But I think they will eventually kill the margins on the profitable chemicals in the niche market. Some top chemical executives share the concern. The challenge for our industry is to keep from getting carried away and repeating past mistakes, GAFs Heyman cautioned. The shift from commodity chemicals may be ill-advised. Specialty businesses do not stay special long. Houston-based Cain Chemical, created this month by the Sterling investment banking group, believes it can generate 700 mln dlrs in annual sales by bucking the industry trend. Chairman Gordon Cain, who previously led a leveraged buyout of Duponts Conoco Incs chemical business, has spent 1.1 billion dlrs since January to buy seven petrochemical plants along the Texas Gulf Coast. The plants produce only basic commodity petrochemicals that are the building blocks of specialty products. This kind of commodity chemical business will never be a glamorous, high-margin business, Cain said, adding that demand is expected to grow by about three pct annually. Garo Armen, an analyst with Dean Witter Reynolds, said chemical makers have also benefitted by increasing demand for plastics as prices become more competitive with aluminum, wood and steel products. Armen estimated the upturn in the chemical business could last as long as four or five years, provided the U.S. economy continues its modest rate of growth.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dean_(education)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dean_Martin	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Rural_Dean	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dean_and_Canons_of_Windsor	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Joshua_Reynolds	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dean_of_Wells	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Burt_Reynolds	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dean_(Christianity)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Howard_Dean	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Reynolds_number	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Forest_of_Dean	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dean_Cemetery	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dean_Koontz	http://dbpedia.org/resource/James_Dean	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bobby_Reynolds	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Debbie_Reynolds	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dean_Parks	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Allen_Reynolds	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dean_of_Exeter	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dean_Stockwell

Poland	488	494	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Poland	Plans to rejuvenate Polands economy by reducing central government control would help reassure Western creditors that the countrys economy was safe to invest in, a senior Polish official said. The business of granting loans to Poland is not as bad a business as you might imagine, senior Polish government spokesman Jerzy Urban told a news conference in Stockholm. Urban, visiting the Swedish capital to deliver a lecture at the Foreign Policy Institute, announced earlier this week that Poland would soon offer shares to private citizens in state companies in a bid to make the economy more responsive. This was part of a major economic reform to be announced in the coming weeks, he said. Urban said the main problem with his countrys foreign debt burden of 32 billion dollars was short term interest charges but the long term looked more secure. He said he hoped talks under way with the Paris Club, grouping Polands main government creditors, would shortly solve the problem of short term servicing. Urban told reporters that debt servicing was hampering the expansion of the national economy, but that the new plans for economic reform would open new vistas for Polish exports. He criticised the blocking efforts of some Western governments, whom he declined to name, for putting political considerations ahead of economic co-operation. After the lifting of U.S. Sanctions against the Polish economy we considered all political obstacles had been removed, but that has not been the case, Urban said.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Voivodeships_of_Poland	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Greater_Poland_Voivodeship	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Lesser_Poland_Voivodeship	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Congress_Poland	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Invasion_of_Poland	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Poland_national_football_team	http://dbpedia.org/resource/First_Partition_of_Poland	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Partitions_of_Poland	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Crown_of_the_Kingdom_of_Poland	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Lesser_Poland	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Nysa,_Poland	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Greater_Poland	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Turek,_Poland	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Flight_and_expulsion_of_Germans_from_Poland_during_and_after_World_War_II	http://dbpedia.org/resource/TVN_(Poland)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Puck,_Poland	http://dbpedia.org/resource/President_of_Poland	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cross_of_Merit_(Poland)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/History_of_Poland	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Police,_Poland
First Boston Corp	0	17	http://dbpedia.org/resource/First_Boston	First Boston Corp analyst William Randol recommended the purchase of Texaco Inc today, saying the discount that investors have made in the share price to reflect the ongoing litigation with Pennzoil has been overdone relative to how we expect the case to conclude. Texacos stock rose 1/8 to 34-1/8. On Monday, the stock tumbled four points after the Supreme Court overturned a lower court decision that cut Texacos bond in the 10.3 billion dlr legal dispute with Pennzoil Co PZL to one billion dlrs. Yesterday, a Texas court granted a temporary injunction on the bond issue pending a hearing next week. The current litigation arose from Texacos buyout of Getty Oil Co in 1984. Pennzoil sued, arguing its earlier agreement to buy Getty was binding. Two Texas state courts upheld Pennzoils position. Randol, noting that the stock has suffered a great deal in the two years since the litigation was filed, said we recognize the legal problems but think investors have overdone it. He said the stock is selling at 48 pct of its asset value, and we think it represents a good value at this level.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Boston	http://dbpedia.org/resource/First-class_cricket	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Boston_University	http://dbpedia.org/resource/First_Nations	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Boston_Red_Sox	http://dbpedia.org/resource/First_baseman	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Boston_College	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Boston_Bruins	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Football_League_First_Division	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Boston_Celtics	http://dbpedia.org/resource/The_Boston_Globe	http://dbpedia.org/resource/First_French_Empire	http://dbpedia.org/resource/First-person_shooter	http://dbpedia.org/resource/First_lieutenant	http://dbpedia.org/resource/First_Lady	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Boston_Marathon	http://dbpedia.org/resource/First_Partition_of_Poland	http://dbpedia.org/resource/List_of_Victoria_first-class_cricketers	http://dbpedia.org/resource/USL_First_Division	http://dbpedia.org/resource/First_Crusade
Dominion Textile	697	713	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dominion_Textile	Dominion Textile Inc considers a published report that it has bought a stake in Burlington Industries Inc and is considering making a joint bid for the company to be a rumor, a company spokesman said. As far as I am concerned and the company is concerned, they are rumors and were not commenting on rumors, spokesman Michel Dufour told Reuters in response to a query. All the information that has been given out publicly is that, yes, Dominion Textile is interested in making an acquisition that big...probably based on that people are starting all sorts of rumors, he said. Dufour said yes when asked whether the report was only a rumor, but said the company was not prepared to comment further. Dominion Textile president and chairman Thomas Bell was out of town and unavailable for comment. Dominion Textile last year made an unsuccesful 104-mln- U.S.-dlr bid for Avondale Mills and has maintained a 120-mln- U.S.-dlr line of credit to be used for an American acquisition. Dufour said the company has been negotiating with many U.S. textile companies but would not say whether Burlington Industries was one of them. Burlingtons stock rose sharply this morning on the report, which said Dominion Textile had joined with U.S. investor Asher Edelman to buy a stake in the company and to consider making a takeover offer. Dominion Textile, which reported operating profit of 11.1 mln Canadian dlrs last year on sales of 926.5 mln dlrs, has repeatedly said it will concentrate on expanding into the U.S. The company has said it plans to diversify into new product and market areas in addition to expanding its textile operations.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Textile	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dominion	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dominion_of_Newfoundland	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Textile_manufacturing	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Old_Dominion_University	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Textile_industry	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Spinning_(textiles)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Spindle_(textiles)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Kings_Dominion	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dominion_of_Ceylon	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dominion_of_Pakistan	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Textile_Bowl	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dominion_of_India	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Textile_arts	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dominion_Lands_Act	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Toronto-Dominion_Bank	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Textile_printing	http://dbpedia.org/resource/The_Dominion_Post_(Wellington)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Stitch_(textile_arts)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dominion_Range

Cordoba	2272	2279	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Córdoba_Province,_Argentina	Argentine grain producers adjusted their yield estimates for the 1986/87 coarse grain crop downward in the week to yesterday after the heavy rains at the end of March and beginning of April, trade sources said. They said sunflower, maize and sorghum production estimates had been reduced despite some later warm, dry weather, which has allowed a return to harvesting in some areas. However, as showers fell intermittently after last weekend, producers feared another spell of prolonged and intense rain could cause more damage to crops already badly hit this season. Rains in the middle of last week reached an average of 27 millimetres in parts of Buenos Aires province, 83 mm in Cordoba, 41 in Santa Fe, 50 in Entre Rios and Misiones, 95 in Corrientes, eight in Chaco and 35 in Formosa. There was no rainfall in the same period in La Pampa. Producers feared continued damp conditions could produce rotting and lead to still lower yield estimates for all the crops, including soybean. However, as the lands began drying later in the week harvesting advanced considerably, reaching between 36 and 40 pct of the area sown in the case of sunflower. Deterioration of the sunflower crop evident in harvested material in Cordoba, La Pampa and Buenos Aires forced yield estimates per hectare to be adjusted down again. The seasons sunflowerseed production is now forecast at 2.1 mln to 2.3 mln tonnes, against 2.2 mln to 2.4 mln forecast last week and down 43.9 to 48.8 pct on the 1985/86 record of 4.1 mln. Area sown to sunflowers was two to 2.2 mln hectares, 29.9 to 36.3 pct below the record 3.14 mln hectares last season. Maize harvesting has also reached 36 to 40 pct of the area sown. It is near completion in Cordoba and Santa Fe and will begin in La Pampa and southern Buenos Aires later in April. Production estimates for maize were down from last week at 9.5 mln to 9.8 mln tonnes, against 9.6 mln to 9.9 mln estimated previously. This is 22.2 to 23.4 pct below the 12.4 mln to 12.6 mln tonnes estimated by private sources for the 1985/86 crop and 21.9 to 25.8 pct down on the official figure of 12.8 mln tonnes. Maize was sown on 3.58 mln to 3.78 mln hectares, two to seven pct down on last seasons 3.85 mln. Sorghum was harvested on 23 to 25 pct of the area sown in Cordoba, Santa Fe and Chaco. Harvest will start in La Pampa and Buenos Aires in mid-April. The total area sown was 1.23 mln to 1.30 mln hectares, 10.3 to 15.2 pct down on the 1.45 mln sown last season. The new forecast for the sorghum crop is 2.9 mln to 3.2 mln tonnes compared with three mln to 3.3 mln forecast last week, and is 23.8 to 29.3 pct down on last seasons 4.1 mln to 4.2 mln tonne crop. The soybean crop for this season was not adjusted, remaining at a record 7.5 mln to 7.7 mln tonnes, up 4.2 to 5.5 pct on the 7.2 mln to 7.3 mln estimated by private sources for 1985/86 and 5.6 to 8.5 pct higher than the official figure of 7.1 mln. The area sown to soybeans this season was a record 3.7 mln to 3.8 mln hectares, 10.8 to 13.8 pct up on the record 3.34 mln sown in 1985/86. The soybean crop is showing excessive moisture in some areas and producers fear they may discover more damage. Some experimental harvesting was carried out in Santa Fe on areas making up only about one pct of the total crop but details on this were not available. Preparation of the fields for the 1987/88 wheat crop, which will be sown between May and August or September, has so far not been as intense as in previous years.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/America/Argentina/Cordoba	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cordoba_Treasure	http://dbpedia.org/resource/MSC_Cordoba	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cordoba_University	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Episcopal_Palace,_Cordoba	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cordoba_Fighting_Dog	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Copa_Agco_Cordoba	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Nicaraguan_ten-cordoba_note	http://dbpedia.org/resource/SS_Sierra_Cordoba_(1913)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Nicaraguan_five_hundred-cordoba_note	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Josh_Cordoba	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Nicaraguan_twenty-cordoba_note	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Catholic_University_of_Cordoba	http://dbpedia.org/resource/2012_Copa_Agco_Cordoba_–_Singles	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cannon_for_Cordoba	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Joaquín_Lloréns_Fernández_de_Cordoba	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cordoba_Agreement,_2006	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cordoba_Initiative	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cordoba_cinclodes	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ricardo_Cordoba
Chiles	501	507	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Lawton_Chiles	The U.S. Senate Budget Committee ended its stalemate over a budget plan and approved by a single vote a revised 1988 budget proposed by chairman Lawton Chiles to cut the deficit to 133.7 billion next year. The new plan broke last week to cut the deficit to 133.7 billion next year. The new plan broke last week's gridlock in which the committee failed to approve a similar Chiles plan on a tie vote. Today, the measure was sent to the Senate 13 to 11. Among a series of changes to get the extra vote, Chiles added about 400 mln dlrs for additional, unspecified, agricultural spending programs to be paid with partly with higher user fees.

La Pampa	2323	2331	http://dbpedia.org/resource/La_Pampa_Province	Argentine grain producers adjusted their yield estimates for the 1986/87 coarse grain crop downward in the week to yesterday after the heavy rains at the end of March and beginning of April, trade sources said. They said sunflower, maize and sorghum production estimates had been reduced despite some later warm, dry weather, which has allowed a return to harvesting in some areas. However, as showers fell intermittently after last weekend, producers feared another spell of prolonged and intense rain could cause more damage to crops already badly hit this season. Rains in the middle of last week reached an average of 27 millimetres in parts of Buenos Aires province, 83 mm in Cordoba, 41 in Santa Fe, 50 in Entre Rios and Misiones, 95 in Corrientes, eight in Chaco and 35 in Formosa. There was no rainfall in the same period in La Pampa. Producers feared continued damp conditions could produce rotting and lead to still lower yield estimates for all the crops, including soybean. However, as the lands began drying later in the week harvesting advanced considerably, reaching between 36 and 40 pct of the area sown in the case of sunflower. Deterioration of the sunflower crop evident in harvested material in Cordoba, La Pampa and Buenos Aires forced yield estimates per hectare to be adjusted down again. The seasons sunflowerseed production is now forecast at 2.1 mln to 2.3 mln tonnes, against 2.2 mln to 2.4 mln forecast last week and down 43.9 to 48.8 pct on the 1985/86 record of 4.1 mln. Area sown to sunflowers was two to 2.2 mln hectares, 29.9 to 36.3 pct below the record 3.14 mln hectares last season. Maize harvesting has also reached 36 to 40 pct of the area sown. It is near completion in Cordoba and Santa Fe and will begin in La Pampa and southern Buenos Aires later in April. Production estimates for maize were down from last week at 9.5 mln to 9.8 mln tonnes, against 9.6 mln to 9.9 mln estimated previously. This is 22.2 to 23.4 pct below the 12.4 mln to 12.6 mln tonnes estimated by private sources for the 1985/86 crop and 21.9 to 25.8 pct down on the official figure of 12.8 mln tonnes. Maize was sown on 3.58 mln to 3.78 mln hectares, two to seven pct down on last seasons 3.85 mln. Sorghum was harvested on 23 to 25 pct of the area sown in Cordoba, Santa Fe and Chaco. Harvest will start in La Pampa and Buenos Aires in mid-April. The total area sown was 1.23 mln to 1.30 mln hectares, 10.3 to 15.2 pct down on the 1.45 mln sown last season. The new forecast for the sorghum crop is 2.9 mln to 3.2 mln tonnes compared with three mln to 3.3 mln forecast last week, and is 23.8 to 29.3 pct down on last seasons 4.1 mln to 4.2 mln tonne crop. The soybean crop for this season was not adjusted, remaining at a record 7.5 mln to 7.7 mln tonnes, up 4.2 to 5.5 pct on the 7.2 mln to 7.3 mln estimated by private sources for 1985/86 and 5.6 to 8.5 pct higher than the official figure of 7.1 mln.

Brazil	1531	1537	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Brazil	J.P. Morgan and Co Inc said its first-quarter earnings fell by 3.2 pct, largely reflecting its previously announced decision to place on non-accrual status its 1.3 billion dlrs of medium- and long-term loans to Brazil. That decision, spurred by Brazils suspension of interest payments on February 20, reduced the quarters net income by 20 mln dlrs to 226.4 mln dlrs, compared with 233.9 mln in the first three months of 1986. Morgan also reported a loss of 1.8 mln dlrs from securities underwriting and trading, in contrast to a gain of 45.4 mln dlrs in the year-earlier period. In the fourth quarter of 1986, Morgan posted other trading losses of 5.5 mln dlrs because of setbacks in the trading and underwriting of Euromarket securities. Conditions in some sectors of the Euromarket remained difficult last quarter, with floating rate notes suffering heavy price falls, but a spokeswoman was unable to say whether Morgans trading losses were restricted to the Euromarket. On the positive side, Morgan reduced its provision for loan losses to 35 mln dlrs from 70 mln a year earlier. Foreign exchange trading income rose to 82 mln dlrs from 72.6 mln and trust income increased to 95.9 mln dlrs from 75.9 mln. Morgan said other operating income, mainly fees and commissions, rose to 102.2 mln dlrs from 88.4 mln, but net investment securities gains dropped to 43.1 mln from 58.1 mln. Net interest earnings were 490.4 mln dlrs in the first quarter, down from 499.4 mln a year earlier, and net yield fell to 2.79 pct from 3.20 pct. If Brazil had not been placed on non-accrual, which means that interest can be recorded as income only when payments are actually received, net interest earnings would have been 525.9 mln dlrs and net yield 2.99 pct. If Brazil does not resume payments, 1987 net would be cut by 72 mln dlrs, Morgan added. After the provision for loan losses, Morgans allowance for credit losses at the end of March totaled 953 mln dlrs compared with 910 mln at end-1986 and 815 mln a year earlier. It reported net recoveries of six mln dlrs after charge-offs of eight mln, compared with net charge-offs of 49 mln dlrs after recoveries of three mln a year earlier. Excluding Brazil, non-accruing loans at quarters end were 583 mln dlrs, down from 633 mln at end-1986 and 684 mln a year earlier. Non-interest expenses rose to 371.1 mln dlrs from 303.5 mln dlrs, with more than half the increase related to personnel costs, Morgan said.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/States_of_Brazil	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Municipalities_of_Brazil	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Regions_of_Brazil	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Northeast_Region,_Brazil	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Brazil_national_football_team	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Southeast_Region,_Brazil	http://dbpedia.org/resource/South_Region,_Brazil	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ministry_of_Transport_(Brazil)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Time_in_Brazil	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Federal_District_(Brazil)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Colonial_Brazil	http://dbpedia.org/resource/President_of_Brazil	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Workers'_Party_(Brazil)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mesoregions_of_Brazil	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Empire_of_Brazil	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Microregions_of_Brazil	http://dbpedia.org/resource/North_Region,_Brazil	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Central-West_Region,_Brazil	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Football_in_Brazil	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pedro_II_of_Brazil
Reuters	336	343	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Reuters	Dominion Textile Inc considers a published report that it has bought a stake in Burlington Industries Inc and is considering making a joint bid for the company to be a rumor, a company spokesman said. As far as I am concerned and the company is concerned, they are rumors and were not commenting on rumors, spokesman Michel Dufour told Reuters in response to a query. All the information that has been given out publicly is that, yes, Dominion Textile is interested in making an acquisition that big...probably based on that people are starting all sorts of rumors, he said. Dufour said yes when asked whether the report was only a rumor, but said the company was not prepared to comment further. Dominion Textile president and chairman Thomas Bell was out of town and unavailable for comment. Dominion Textile last year made an unsuccesful 104-mln- U.S.-dlr bid for Avondale Mills and has maintained a 120-mln- U.S.-dlr line of credit to be used for an American acquisition. Dufour said the company has been negotiating with many U.S. textile companies but would not say whether Burlington Industries was one of them. Burlingtons stock rose sharply this morning on the report, which said Dominion Textile had joined with U.S. investor Asher Edelman to buy a stake in the company and to consider making a takeover offer. Dominion Textile, which reported operating profit of 11.1 mln Canadian dlrs last year on sales of 926.5 mln dlrs, has repeatedly said it will concentrate on expanding into the U.S. The company has said it plans to diversify into new product and market areas in addition to expanding its textile operations.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thomson_Reuters	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Reuters_Group	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Reuters_3000_Xtra	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thomson_Reuters_Foundation	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thomson_Reuters_Indices	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thomson_Reuters_Citation_Laureates	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Reuters_Digital_Vision_Program	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Reuters_Institute_for_the_Study_of_Journalism	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thomson_Reuters_Business_Classification	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Reuters_TV	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Reuters_Insider	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Reuters_Market_Data_System	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Calais_(Reuters_product)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thomson_Reuters_Realized_Volatility_Index	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thomson_Reuters_Messenger	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Reuters_Market_Light	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Reuters_Instrument_Code	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thomson_Reuters_league_tables

Pennzoil	190	198	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pennzoil	First Boston Corp analyst William Randol recommended the purchase of Texaco Inc today, saying the discount that investors have made in the share price to reflect the ongoing litigation with Pennzoil has been overdone relative to how we expect the case to conclude. Texacos stock rose 1/8 to 34-1/8. On Monday, the stock tumbled four points after the Supreme Court overturned a lower court decision that cut Texacos bond in the 10.3 billion dlr legal dispute with Pennzoil Co PZL to one billion dlrs. Yesterday, a Texas court granted a temporary injunction on the bond issue pending a hearing next week. The current litigation arose from Texacos buyout of Getty Oil Co in 1984. Pennzoil sued, arguing its earlier agreement to buy Getty was binding. Two Texas state courts upheld Pennzoils position. Randol, noting that the stock has suffered a great deal in the two years since the litigation was filed, said we recognize the legal problems but think investors have overdone it. He said the stock is selling at 48 pct of its asset value, and we think it represents a good value at this level.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pennzoil_Place	http://dbpedia.org/resource/2000_Pennzoil_400	http://dbpedia.org/resource/1997_Pennzoil_200	http://dbpedia.org/resource/2001_Pennzoil_Freedom_400	http://dbpedia.org/resource/1999_Pennzoil_400	http://dbpedia.org/resource/2013_Shell-Pennzoil_Grand_Prix_of_Houston
CME	300	303	http://dbpedia.org/resource/CME_Group	The Chicago Mercantile Exchange, CME, said it has added a new chief compliance officer and will expand its regulatory surveillance program. Paul OKelly, currently assistant regional administrator of the Securities and Exchange Commission, was named vice-president of compliance for the exchange, the CME said. The expanded compliance program, which calls for an increase in the exchanges compliance budget and addition of staff, was in response to recent criticisms that the CMEs current surveillance was not able to keep up with increased demands of recent volatility and volume, the CME said. The new surveillance program calls for the addition of three floor investigators and five compliance investigators, the CME said. Some of the new staff will monitor the exchanges new Computerized Trade Reconstruction system, scheduled to start July 1. In addition, three computer programmers will be added to assist in regulatory support for the exchanges management information system department. Recent criticism has been especially directed at the CMEs Standard and Poors stock index futures and options division. A special membership referendum to prohibit CME members from filling customer orders and trading for their own account in S and P 500 futures and options will be voted on April 13. In a letter dated March 12, CME chairman John Sandner and Executive committee chairman Leo Melamed urged members to reject the referendum in favor a series of new rules. Included in the rule changes was the requirement that futures brokers in the S and P pit manually record all personal trades to the nearest minute, intended to enhance the effectiveness of surveillance and compliance functions, We made a promise to our members that we have kept, Melamed said in a release today. He said the new surveillance program represents a commitment to a vigorous enforcement policy.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/CME_Group_Tour_Championship	http://dbpedia.org/resource/2013_CME_Group_Titleholders	http://dbpedia.org/resource/2015_CME_Group_Tour_Championship	http://dbpedia.org/resource/CME_SPAN	http://dbpedia.org/resource/2012_CME_Group_Titleholders	http://dbpedia.org/resource/2011_CME_Group_Titleholders	http://dbpedia.org/resource/2014_CME_Group_Tour_Championship	http://dbpedia.org/resource/2016_CME_Group_Tour_Championship	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Phillips_Chapel_CME_Church
Supreme Court	158	171	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States	Securities and Exchange Commission John Shad said he wanted Congress to write a better definition of insider trading but thought action should wait until the Supreme Court ruled on an insider trading case. Id like the benefit of the Winans decision before deciding on a definition, Shad told a Senate Appropriations subcommittee hearing. Shad was refering to the appeal by former Wall Street Journal reporter R. Foster Winans of his conviction on insider trading charges for telling a friend in advance what stocks he was going to write about in his column. The stocks usually went up or down in price depending on Winans recommendation. He said insider trading accounted for only 11 percent of the SECs enforcement activities last year despite the publicity given to recent major cases. Insider trading makes up only a tiny fraction of one pct of the 50 billion dlrs of daily securities trading, Shad said. Shad asked for a budget increase so the SEC could enlarge its enforcement staff by 20 this year and 73 next year to deal with all types of securities fraud. Shad said he hoped to start his new duties as U.S. Ambassador to the Netherlands by June. He said he did not know when his successor would be named by President Reagan.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Supreme_Court_of_Canada	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tennis_court	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Court	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Supreme_Court_of_India	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Clay_court	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Supreme_court	http://dbpedia.org/resource/High_Court_of_Justice	http://dbpedia.org/resource/European_Court_of_Justice	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Supreme_Court_of_Norway	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Iowa_Supreme_Court	http://dbpedia.org/resource/European_Court_of_Human_Rights	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Supreme_Court_of_Victoria	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Court_of_Appeal_of_New_Zealand	http://dbpedia.org/resource/International_Court_of_Justice	http://dbpedia.org/resource/List_of_United_States_Supreme_Court_cases	http://dbpedia.org/resource/United_States_Court_of_Appeals_for_the_Ninth_Circuit	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Court_of_Appeal_of_England_and_Wales	http://dbpedia.org/resource/High_Court_of_New_Zealand	http://dbpedia.org/resource/High_Court_of_Australia	http://dbpedia.org/resource/New_York_Supreme_Court

Reagan	145	151	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ronald_Reagan	A Treasury official said there are no plans to try to reduce the U.S. budget deficit by issuing yen-denominated bonds that would become known as Reagan bonds. It simply isnt something that we are planning to do, the official said. He added the Treasury was aware of Japanese news reports suggesting the Reagan administration might issue such bonds as the former Carter administration did when it sold Carter bonds denominated in West German marks. But he said the situation was greatly different now. If you look at the differences between the treasury market now and in the Carter administration years, it is a much more global market now, the official said. There was not the same ease then for the holder of another currency to buy other countries securities, he added, But there is no difficulty now for them to purchase dollars and buy U.S. securities. The United States needs dollars, not Japanese yen, to pay its debts and reduce the deficit and so has no plans to issue yen-denominated bonds, he emphasized.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Nancy_Reagan	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Presidency_of_Ronald_Reagan	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ronald_Reagan_Washington_National_Airport	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Reagan_Youth	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ronald_Reagan_Presidential_Library	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ronald_Reagan_UCLA_Medical_Center	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Michael_Reagan	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ron_Reagan	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Reagan_Doctrine	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Attempted_assassination_of_Ronald_Reagan	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Reagan_County,_Texas	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Maureen_Reagan	http://dbpedia.org/resource/List_of_federal_judges_appointed_by_Ronald_Reagan	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ronald_Reagan_in_music	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Reagan_Pasternak	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ronald_Reagan_filmography	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ronald_Reagan_Ballistic_Missile_Defense_Test_Site	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ronald_Reagan_Cross_County_Highway	http://dbpedia.org/resource/The_Reagans	http://dbpedia.org/resource/USS_Ronald_Reagan
VW	22	24	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Volkswagen_Group	Volkswagen AG VOWG.F, VW, is due to make a formal announcement about its 1986 dividend tomorrow after saying the 1985 level of 10 marks per ordinary share would be held, despite massive losses because of a suspected foreign currency fraud. A spokesman said VWs supervisory board will meet tomorrow to discuss the payout. A statement will be made afterwards. VW has also said disclosed profits for 1986 will reach their 1985 level, despite provisions of a possible 480 mln marks linked to the currency affair. The figure is virtually the same as the 477 mln mark 1985 parent company net profit. When VW first confirmed the currency scandal on March 10 it said the management board would propose an unchanged 10-mark dividend to the supervisory board. A dividend of 11 marks would be proposed for the companys new preference shares. Share analysts said they saw supervisory board approval of the management board proposal as virtually a formality. Anything else would be more than a surprise, one said. Company sources said VW would have to dig into reserves to maintain the disclosed profit. Parent company reserves stood at around three billion marks at end-1985.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Better_Half_VW	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cal-Style_VW	http://dbpedia.org/resource/VW_276_Schlepperfahrzeug	http://dbpedia.org/resource/VW_Cephei	http://dbpedia.org/resource/VW_Hydri	http://dbpedia.org/resource/VW_Herald	http://dbpedia.org/resource/VW_Electronics_Research_Laboratory

Cordoba	1216	1223	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Córdoba_Province,_Argentina	Argentine grain producers adjusted their yield estimates for the 1986/87 coarse grain crop downward in the week to yesterday after the heavy rains at the end of March and beginning of April, trade sources said. They said sunflower, maize and sorghum production estimates had been reduced despite some later warm, dry weather, which has allowed a return to harvesting in some areas. However, as showers fell intermittently after last weekend, producers feared another spell of prolonged and intense rain could cause more damage to crops already badly hit this season. Rains in the middle of last week reached an average of 27 millimetres in parts of Buenos Aires province, 83 mm in Cordoba, 41 in Santa Fe, 50 in Entre Rios and Misiones, 95 in Corrientes, eight in Chaco and 35 in Formosa. There was no rainfall in the same period in La Pampa. Producers feared continued damp conditions could produce rotting and lead to still lower yield estimates for all the crops, including soybean. However, as the lands began drying later in the week harvesting advanced considerably, reaching between 36 and 40 pct of the area sown in the case of sunflower. Deterioration of the sunflower crop evident in harvested material in Cordoba, La Pampa and Buenos Aires forced yield estimates per hectare to be adjusted down again. The seasons sunflowerseed production is now forecast at 2.1 mln to 2.3 mln tonnes, against 2.2 mln to 2.4 mln forecast last week and down 43.9 to 48.8 pct on the 1985/86 record of 4.1 mln. Area sown to sunflowers was two to 2.2 mln hectares, 29.9 to 36.3 pct below the record 3.14 mln hectares last season. Maize harvesting has also reached 36 to 40 pct of the area sown. It is near completion in Cordoba and Santa Fe and will begin in La Pampa and southern Buenos Aires later in April. Production estimates for maize were down from last week at 9.5 mln to 9.8 mln tonnes, against 9.6 mln to 9.9 mln estimated previously. This is 22.2 to 23.4 pct below the 12.4 mln to 12.6 mln tonnes estimated by private sources for the 1985/86 crop and 21.9 to 25.8 pct down on the official figure of 12.8 mln tonnes. Maize was sown on 3.58 mln to 3.78 mln hectares, two to seven pct down on last seasons 3.85 mln. Sorghum was harvested on 23 to 25 pct of the area sown in Cordoba, Santa Fe and Chaco. Harvest will start in La Pampa and Buenos Aires in mid-April. The total area sown was 1.23 mln to 1.30 mln hectares, 10.3 to 15.2 pct down on the 1.45 mln sown last season. The new forecast for the sorghum crop is 2.9 mln to 3.2 mln tonnes compared with three mln to 3.3 mln forecast last week, and is 23.8 to 29.3 pct down on last seasons 4.1 mln to 4.2 mln tonne crop. The soybean crop for this season was not adjusted, remaining at a record 7.5 mln to 7.7 mln tonnes, up 4.2 to 5.5 pct on the 7.2 mln to 7.3 mln estimated by private sources for 1985/86 and 5.6 to 8.5 pct higher than the official figure of 7.1 mln. The area sown to soybeans this season was a record 3.7 mln to 3.8 mln hectares, 10.8 to 13.8 pct up on the record 3.34 mln sown in 1985/86. The soybean crop is showing excessive moisture in some areas and producers fear they may discover more damage. Some experimental harvesting was carried out in Santa Fe on areas making up only about one pct of the total crop but details on this were not available. Preparation of the fields for the 1987/88 wheat crop, which will be sown between May and August or September, has so far not been as intense as in previous years.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/America/Argentina/Cordoba	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cordoba_Treasure	http://dbpedia.org/resource/MSC_Cordoba	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cordoba_University	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Episcopal_Palace,_Cordoba	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cordoba_Fighting_Dog	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Copa_Agco_Cordoba	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Nicaraguan_ten-cordoba_note	http://dbpedia.org/resource/SS_Sierra_Cordoba_(1913)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Nicaraguan_five_hundred-cordoba_note	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Josh_Cordoba	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Nicaraguan_twenty-cordoba_note	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Catholic_University_of_Cordoba	http://dbpedia.org/resource/2012_Copa_Agco_Cordoba_–_Singles	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cannon_for_Cordoba	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Joaquín_Lloréns_Fernández_de_Cordoba	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cordoba_Agreement,_2006	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cordoba_Initiative	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cordoba_cinclodes	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ricardo_Cordoba
Edouard Balladur	301	317	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Édouard_Balladur	Top officials of leading industrial nations arrived at the U.S. Treasury main building to begin a meeting of the Group of Five. Officials seen arriving by Reuter correspondents included West German Finance Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg and Bundesbank President Karl Otto Poehl, French Finance Minister Edouard Balladur and his central banker Jacques de Larosiere. Also seen arriving were Japanese Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa and Japans central bank governor Satoshi Sumita and British Chancellor of the Exchequer and central bank governor Robin Leigh Pemberton. There was no immediate sign of Italian or Canadian officials. Monetary sources have said a fully blown meeting of the Group of Seven is expected to begin around 3 p.m. local time (1900 gmt) and last at least until 6 p.m. (2200 gmt), when a communique is expected to be issued. Italian sources said Italian acting Finance Minister Giovanni Goria met Treasury Secretary James Baker last night. At those talks Baker apparently convinced Goria, who declined to attend the February meeting of the Group of Seven in Paris, that Italy would participate fully in any meaningful decisions.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Balladur_jurisprudence	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Jules_Edouard_Roiné	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Edouard_Fesinger	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Edouard_Agneessens	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Calvin_Edouard_Ward	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Edouard_Kutter_(1887)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Edouard_Grikurov	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Edouard_Osy_de_Zegwaart	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Frans_Hubert_Edouard_Arthur_Walter_Robyns	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Edouard_Wattez	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Edouard_Lapaglie	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Edouard_Izac	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Edouard_Aleata	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Jean-Edouard_de_Castella	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Edouard_Suenson_Memorial	http://dbpedia.org/resource/William_Edouard_Scott	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Edouard_Joseph	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tropical_Storm_Edouard_(2008)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Musée_Edouard_Branly	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Edouard_Borovansky
Dominion	1139	1147	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dominion_Textile	The largest U.S. textile maker focused on its own business as its competitors found merger partners, but now Burlington Industries Inc may have restructured itself into an attractive takeover candidate, analysts said. The takeover spotlight fell today on Burlington, which rose 4-7/8 to 52-7/8 on speculation that investor Asher Edelman and Dominion Textiles Inc of Canada bought an almost five pct stake. A published report said Edelman and Dominion jointly acquired a stake in Burlington and were weighing a takeover offer. Edelman would not comment, and a spokesman for Montreal-based Dominion called the report just rumors. Burlington said it did not know if the report was true. Wall Street professionals said they were not convinced of the story or that Edelman and Dominion would be the victors if Burlington actually came into play. Arbitragers said past comments from Dominion, however, added credence to the speculation. Dominion has said that it was looking for a takeover in the U.S. Last year, Dominion unsuccessfully bid for Avondale Mills and has maintained a 120 mln dlr line of credit to be used for a U.S. acquisition. A Dominion spokesman said Canadas largest textile producer has been negotiating with many U.S. textile companies, but would not say whether Burlington was among them. There have been acquisitions in this area. Its not unusual that someone could be looking at Burlington after the housecleaning theyve done, said Eileen Gormley of Thomson McKinnon. Burlington sold its domestic operations, which made sheets and other linens, to J.P. Stevens and Co Inc for 110 mln dlrs last year. It also has reorganized management, and focused its operations on businesses that would be less affected by foreign competition, Gormley said. Theyve pulled back so as not to be a commodity marketer, said Gormley. She said in moving more heavily into industrial fabrics, Burlington bought C.H. Masland, which supplies carpets and other fabric to the auto industry. In the past, they just spent and never realized the return on the outlays they did make, she said. You look at their record over the year, and I think theyre poised to be more profitable than they had been in the past, Gormley said. She estimated 1987 earnings of 2.50 dlrs per share, up from 2.01 dlrs per share. Some analysts today recommended clients not buy Burlington at its current levels. Edward Johnson of Johnson Redbook said he recommends selling. He said he believes the stock is worth only about 50 dlrs on a takeover basis and about 46 dlrs on an earnings basis. Some arbitragers, however, said takeover values have been placed on the company of 60 to 65 dlrs per share. After Ashers (Edelman) recent history, a lot of people dont find him very credible anymore, said one arbitrager. Another, however, said Edelman succeeds in forcing managements to take steps to enhance shareholder values even if he doesnt win the target company. Edelman was unsuccessful last year in offers for Lucky Stores Inc and Fruehauf Corp. He did succeed in buying Ponderosa Inc. The stocks of other textile makers rose along with Burlington. J.P. Stevens STN climbed 5/8 to 44-7/8, and Fieldcrest Cannon Inc FLD, the result of a merger of Fieldcrest and Cannon, rose 1-1/8 to 39-3/4. West Point-Pepperell Inc WPM rose 1-7/8 to 67-1/8.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dominion	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dominion_of_Newfoundland	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Old_Dominion_University	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Kings_Dominion	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dominion_of_Ceylon	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dominion_of_Pakistan	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dominion_of_India	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dominion_Lands_Act	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Toronto-Dominion_Bank	http://dbpedia.org/resource/The_Dominion_Post_(Wellington)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dominion_Range	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dominion_Land_Survey	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dominion_Resources	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dominion_Theatre	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dominion_Atlantic_Railway	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Inter_Dominion	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dominion_Enterprises	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dominion_(Star_Trek)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dominion_Astrophysical_Observatory	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dominion_of_New_England

Melamed	1743	1750	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Leo_Melamed	The Chicago Mercantile Exchange, CME, said it has added a new chief compliance officer and will expand its regulatory surveillance program. Paul OKelly, currently assistant regional administrator of the Securities and Exchange Commission, was named vice-president of compliance for the exchange, the CME said. The expanded compliance program, which calls for an increase in the exchanges compliance budget and addition of staff, was in response to recent criticisms that the CMEs current surveillance was not able to keep up with increased demands of recent volatility and volume, the CME said. The new surveillance program calls for the addition of three floor investigators and five compliance investigators, the CME said. Some of the new staff will monitor the exchanges new Computerized Trade Reconstruction system, scheduled to start July 1. In addition, three computer programmers will be added to assist in regulatory support for the exchanges management information system department. Recent criticism has been especially directed at the CMEs Standard and Poors stock index futures and options division. A special membership referendum to prohibit CME members from filling customer orders and trading for their own account in S and P 500 futures and options will be voted on April 13. In a letter dated March 12, CME chairman John Sandner and Executive committee chairman Leo Melamed urged members to reject the referendum in favor a series of new rules. Included in the rule changes was the requirement that futures brokers in the S and P pit manually record all personal trades to the nearest minute, intended to enhance the effectiveness of surveillance and compliance functions, We made a promise to our members that we have kept, Melamed said in a release today. He said the new surveillance program represents a commitment to a vigorous enforcement policy.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Vince_Melamed	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Melamed	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Eliezer_Melamed	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Fred_Melamed	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ken_Melamed	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ezra_Zion_Melamed	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Zalman_Baruch_Melamed	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Guy_Melamed	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Douglas_Melamed	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Avraham_Melamed	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Maickel_Melamed	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Stephen_Melamed	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Joel_Melamed_and_Hurwitz_v_Cleveland_Estates
Reagan	1815	1821	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ronald_Reagan	Senior Japanese officials tomorrow open talks with American trade negotiators in a last-ditch effort to avert new high U.S. tariffs to be imposed on a wide variety of Japanese electronic exports. Makoto Kuroda, vice minister of Japans Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI), is to hold two days of meetings with the Deputy U.S. Trade Representative, Michael Smith, and the Under Secretary of Commerce, Bruce Smart. The new tariffs, to go into effect on April 17, are in retaliation for Japans failure to adhere to an agreement to end dumping semiconductors in world markets at below cost and to open its home market to U.S. semiconductor shipments. They are to be imposed on goods which use semiconductors, including television and audio equipment and computers. Both U.S. and Japanese officials have said there was little likelihood the talks would do anything to avert the 100 pct duties on 300 mln dlrs worth of Japanese shipments. President Reagan announced the planned tariffs on March 27 after he said that close monitoring of the July 1986 U.S.-Japanese semiconductor pact convinced U.S. officials that Japan was not honoring the agreement. In making the annoucement, Reagan said I am committed to the full enforcement of our trade agreements designed to provide American industry with free and fair trade. Trade analysts said his move was aimed as much at Japans semiconductor trade practices, which are said to have injured the U.S. semiconductor industry, as Congress, which has complained about presidential timidity on trade issues. Congressional Democrats have pledged to enact aggressive trade laws to counter what they contend has been Reagans inaction to redress the growing U.S. trade deficit, which last year reached 169.8 billion dlrs. About one-third of the deficit was with Japan. Reagan said there were recent signs Japan was beginning to adhere to the pact and that was why he was not terminating it. Kuroda said on leaving Tokyo today he had no new proposals but did have an explanation of the semiconductor situation. He told the daily newspaper Ashai Shimbun that Reagans decision was based on inaccurate data and an exaggerated sense of MITIs power to control Japanese traders. The United States has excessive expectations., he said. To stabilize supply-demand relations which have been disrupted by excess inventories since 1985 will take some time. He also said that U.S. firms had not been aggressive enough in trying to sell in the Japanese market.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Nancy_Reagan	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Presidency_of_Ronald_Reagan	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ronald_Reagan_Washington_National_Airport	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Reagan_Youth	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ronald_Reagan_Presidential_Library	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ronald_Reagan_UCLA_Medical_Center	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Michael_Reagan	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ron_Reagan	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Reagan_Doctrine	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Attempted_assassination_of_Ronald_Reagan	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Reagan_County,_Texas	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Maureen_Reagan	http://dbpedia.org/resource/List_of_federal_judges_appointed_by_Ronald_Reagan	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ronald_Reagan_in_music	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Reagan_Pasternak	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ronald_Reagan_filmography	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ronald_Reagan_Ballistic_Missile_Defense_Test_Site	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ronald_Reagan_Cross_County_Highway	http://dbpedia.org/resource/The_Reagans	http://dbpedia.org/resource/USS_Ronald_Reagan
Iran	619	623	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Iran	Iran decided to continue its operations east of Basra to destroy Iraqs forces, Iranian Prime Minister Mir-Hossein Mousavi told Tehran Radio. That seems to be the best spot for the complete destruction of (Iraqi President) Saddams forces. This is why it was decided that the operations would forcefully continue there, he said. At the same time, we have maintained our ability to act throughout the length of the fronts, Mousavi told the radio, monitored by the British Broadcasting Corporation. Tehran Radio reported over 1,500 Iraqi casualties today as Iran continued its Karbala-8 operation launched early yesterday. Iran said over 2,600 Iraqis had been killed or wounded yesterday. Iraq said today its forces had beaten back the latest attacks inflicting heavy casualties. Mousavi told Tehran radio that on the whole, our advances have broken the back of the military forces of Saddam. Earlier today the Iranian news agency IRNA said Tehrans forces were stabilising new positions after their assault on Iraqi lines defending Basra, Iraqs second city. In Baghdad, a military spokesman said Iraqi warplanes today destroyed an oil pumping station and a production unit at Irans Ahvaz field.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Provinces_of_Iran	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Counties_of_Iran	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Iran_Standard_Time	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Iran–Iraq_War	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Iran_national_football_team	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Arak,_Iran	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Azerbaijan_(Iran)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cinema_of_Iran	http://dbpedia.org/resource/President_of_Iran	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Rey,_Iran	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Iran_hostage_crisis	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Zanjan,_Iran	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sari,_Iran	http://dbpedia.org/resource/2013–14_Iran_Pro_League	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Prime_Minister_of_Iran	http://dbpedia.org/resource/History_of_Iran	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sarband_District_(Iran)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Supreme_Leader_of_Iran	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Music_of_Iran	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Greater_Iran

DTI	648	651	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Department_of_Trade_and_Industry_(United_Kingdom)	Britain intends to negotiate further agreements on international securities regulation to match those now in force with the U.S. And Japan, government sources said. The Department of Trade and Industry said earlier it had concluded a memorandum of understanding with Japans Finance Ministry to swap supervisory and investigatory information. The agreement covers stocks, shares and government bonds, but not commodity futures, whose regulation in Japan does not come under the Finance Ministry. It therefore does not cover some transactions on the London International Financial Futures Exchange and the London commodities and metal exchanges. The DTI said it hoped to seek further understandings with other countries which met in the U.K. Last December. The meeting involved delegates from the U.K., Switzerland, the U.S., Canada, Australia, Hong Kong, Japan, France, West Germany and Holland. Government sources said the deal with Japan completes arrangements linking Tokyo, the U.S. And London. A U.K. Agreement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) was signed last September. Todays agreement will deal with requests for information on a case by case basis, U.K. Government sources said. It is not legally binding and comes into force immediately.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/DTI_Data	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thomson_DTI_6300-16
Cordoba	681	688	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Córdoba_Province,_Argentina	Argentine grain producers adjusted their yield estimates for the 1986/87 coarse grain crop downward in the week to yesterday after the heavy rains at the end of March and beginning of April, trade sources said. They said sunflower, maize and sorghum production estimates had been reduced despite some later warm, dry weather, which has allowed a return to harvesting in some areas. However, as showers fell intermittently after last weekend, producers feared another spell of prolonged and intense rain could cause more damage to crops already badly hit this season. Rains in the middle of last week reached an average of 27 millimetres in parts of Buenos Aires province, 83 mm in Cordoba, 41 in Santa Fe, 50 in Entre Rios and Misiones, 95 in Corrientes, eight in Chaco and 35 in Formosa. There was no rainfall in the same period in La Pampa. Producers feared continued damp conditions could produce rotting and lead to still lower yield estimates for all the crops, including soybean. However, as the lands began drying later in the week harvesting advanced considerably, reaching between 36 and 40 pct of the area sown in the case of sunflower. Deterioration of the sunflower crop evident in harvested material in Cordoba, La Pampa and Buenos Aires forced yield estimates per hectare to be adjusted down again. The seasons sunflowerseed production is now forecast at 2.1 mln to 2.3 mln tonnes, against 2.2 mln to 2.4 mln forecast last week and down 43.9 to 48.8 pct on the 1985/86 record of 4.1 mln. Area sown to sunflowers was two to 2.2 mln hectares, 29.9 to 36.3 pct below the record 3.14 mln hectares last season. Maize harvesting has also reached 36 to 40 pct of the area sown. It is near completion in Cordoba and Santa Fe and will begin in La Pampa and southern Buenos Aires later in April. Production estimates for maize were down from last week at 9.5 mln to 9.8 mln tonnes, against 9.6 mln to 9.9 mln estimated previously. This is 22.2 to 23.4 pct below the 12.4 mln to 12.6 mln tonnes estimated by private sources for the 1985/86 crop and 21.9 to 25.8 pct down on the official figure of 12.8 mln tonnes. Maize was sown on 3.58 mln to 3.78 mln hectares, two to seven pct down on last seasons 3.85 mln. Sorghum was harvested on 23 to 25 pct of the area sown in Cordoba, Santa Fe and Chaco. Harvest will start in La Pampa and Buenos Aires in mid-April. The total area sown was 1.23 mln to 1.30 mln hectares, 10.3 to 15.2 pct down on the 1.45 mln sown last season. The new forecast for the sorghum crop is 2.9 mln to 3.2 mln tonnes compared with three mln to 3.3 mln forecast last week, and is 23.8 to 29.3 pct down on last seasons 4.1 mln to 4.2 mln tonne crop. The soybean crop for this season was not adjusted, remaining at a record 7.5 mln to 7.7 mln tonnes, up 4.2 to 5.5 pct on the 7.2 mln to 7.3 mln estimated by private sources for 1985/86 and 5.6 to 8.5 pct higher than the official figure of 7.1 mln. The area sown to soybeans this season was a record 3.7 mln to 3.8 mln hectares, 10.8 to 13.8 pct up on the record 3.34 mln sown in 1985/86. The soybean crop is showing excessive moisture in some areas and producers fear they may discover more damage. Some experimental harvesting was carried out in Santa Fe on areas making up only about one pct of the total crop but details on this were not available. Preparation of the fields for the 1987/88 wheat crop, which will be sown between May and August or September, has so far not been as intense as in previous years.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/America/Argentina/Cordoba	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cordoba_Treasure	http://dbpedia.org/resource/MSC_Cordoba	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cordoba_University	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Episcopal_Palace,_Cordoba	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cordoba_Fighting_Dog	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Copa_Agco_Cordoba	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Nicaraguan_ten-cordoba_note	http://dbpedia.org/resource/SS_Sierra_Cordoba_(1913)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Nicaraguan_five_hundred-cordoba_note	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Josh_Cordoba	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Nicaraguan_twenty-cordoba_note	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Catholic_University_of_Cordoba	http://dbpedia.org/resource/2012_Copa_Agco_Cordoba_–_Singles	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cannon_for_Cordoba	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Joaquín_Lloréns_Fernández_de_Cordoba	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cordoba_Agreement,_2006	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cordoba_Initiative	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cordoba_cinclodes	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ricardo_Cordoba

Tehran Radio reported over 1,500 Iraqi casualties today as Iran continued its Karbala-8 operation launched early yesterday. Iran said over 2,600 Iraqis had been killed or wounded yesterday. Iraq said today its forces had beaten back the latest attacks inflicting heavy casualties. Mousavi told Tehran radio that on the whole, our advances have broken the back of the military forces of Saddam. Earlier today the Iranian news agency IRNA said Tehrans forces were stabilising new positions after their assault on Iraqi lines defending Basra, Iraqs second city.

Plant Vogtle nuclear power station	134	168	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Vogtle_Electric_Generating_Plant	An audit submitted to the Georgia Public Service Commission claims that between 944 mln dlrs and 1.8 billion dlrs of the costs of the Plant Vogtle nuclear power station should be disallowed, a Southern Co spokeswoman said. Southerns Georgia Power Co subsidiary has a 45.7 pct interest in the plant and estimated earlier this year it would cost a total of 8.87 billion dlrs. Last year, the plants owners pledged to Georgia regulators they would limit the cost passed on to rate payers to 8.4 billion dlrs. The Southern spokeswoman said the company feels the report by OBrien-Kreitzberg is flawed and biased. She said the report was released yesterday by the state attorney general. Responding to the report today, Georgia Power Chairman Robert W. Scherer told a news conference the conclusions drawn by the firm are not only wrong -- they also reflect the same bias against nuclear power that these auditors have demonstrated in similar cases accross the country. Saying he was not suggesting Georgia power was without fault, Scherer said the audit identified several things I wish we had done differently. Scherer pointed out a report OBrien-Kreitzberg submitted to Georgia regulators in March 1986 projected Georgia Power would not finish Plant Vogtle unit one before the end of 1987. Noting unit one is finished, and we expect it to be in commercial operationg by June, he said the firms latest report ignored the earlier projection, gave the utility no credit for the completion and actually penalized us by suggesting that costs to maintain t he schedule be disallowed. Scherer said the latest audit alleges Georgia Power could have saved 95 mln dlrs if it had stopped using four shifts, seven days a week to speed construction three years sooner. He said this would have delayed completion of the plant for another year and it would have cost several hunderd million dlrs more. Noting the audit said costs were increased 600 mln dlrs by schedule delays totaling 20.5 months, he said First, we have the best concrete placement record in the industry, Second new government regulations after the Three Mile Island incident significantly increased construction time.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Plant	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Radio_station	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Flowering_plant	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Train_station	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Metro_station	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Perennial_plant	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Power_metal	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Television_station	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Power_pop	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Nuclear_power	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Power_station	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Native_plant	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Power_forward_(basketball)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/McMurdo_Station	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ornamental_plant	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Electric_power	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Herbaceous_plant	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Nuclear_power_plant	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Nuclear_Blast	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Annual_plant
London	990	996	http://dbpedia.org/resource/London	Britain intends to negotiate further agreements on international securities regulation to match those now in force with the U.S. And Japan, government sources said. The Department of Trade and Industry said earlier it had concluded a memorandum of understanding with Japans Finance Ministry to swap supervisory and investigatory information. The agreement covers stocks, shares and government bonds, but not commodity futures, whose regulation in Japan does not come under the Finance Ministry. It therefore does not cover some transactions on the London International Financial Futures Exchange and the London commodities and metal exchanges. The DTI said it hoped to seek further understandings with other countries which met in the U.K. Last December. The meeting involved delegates from the U.K., Switzerland, the U.S., Canada, Australia, Hong Kong, Japan, France, West Germany and Holland. Government sources said the deal with Japan completes arrangements linking Tokyo, the U.S. And London. A U.K. Agreement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) was signed last September.

Burlington Industries Inc	109	134	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Burlington_Industries	The largest U.S. textile maker focused on its own business as its competitors found merger partners, but now Burlington Industries Inc may have restructured itself into an attractive takeover candidate, analysts said. The takeover spotlight fell today on Burlington, which rose 4-7/8 to 52-7/8 on speculation that investor Asher Edelman and Dominion Textiles Inc of Canada bought an almost five pct stake. A published report said Edelman and Dominion jointly acquired a stake in Burlington and were weighing a takeover offer. Edelman would not comment, and a spokesman for Montreal-based Dominion called the report just rumors. Burlington said it did not know if the report was true. Wall Street professionals said they were not convinced of the story or that Edelman and Dominion would be the victors if Burlington actually came into play. Arbitragers said past comments from Dominion, however, added credence to the speculation. Dominion has said that it was looking for a takeover in the U.S. Last year, Dominion unsuccessfully bid for Avondale Mills and has maintained a 120 mln dlr line of credit to be used for a U.S. acquisition. A Dominion spokesman said Canadas largest textile producer has been negotiating with many U.S. textile companies, but would not say whether Burlington was among them. There have been acquisitions in this area. Its not unusual that someone could be looking at Burlington after the housecleaning theyve done, said Eileen Gormley of Thomson McKinnon. Burlington sold its domestic operations, which made sheets and other linens, to J.P. Stevens and Co Inc for 110 mln dlrs last year. It also has reorganized management, and focused its operations on businesses that would be less affected by foreign competition, Gormley said. Theyve pulled back so as not to be a commodity marketer, said Gormley. She said in moving more heavily into industrial fabrics, Burlington bought C.H. Masland, which supplies carpets and other fabric to the auto industry. In the past, they just spent and never realized the return on the outlays they did make, she said. You look at their record over the year, and I think theyre poised to be more profitable than they had been in the past, Gormley said. She estimated 1987 earnings of 2.50 dlrs per share, up from 2.01 dlrs per share. Some analysts today recommended clients not buy Burlington at its current levels. Edward Johnson of Johnson Redbook said he recommends selling. He said he believes the stock is worth only about 50 dlrs on a takeover basis and about 46 dlrs on an earnings basis. Some arbitragers, however, said takeover values have been placed on the company of 60 to 65 dlrs per share. After Ashers (Edelman) recent history, a lot of people dont find him very credible anymore, said one arbitrager. Another, however, said Edelman succeeds in forcing managements to take steps to enhance shareholder values even if he doesnt win the target company. Edelman was unsuccessful last year in offers for Lucky Stores Inc and Fruehauf Corp. He did succeed in buying Ponderosa Inc. The stocks of other textile makers rose along with Burlington. J.P. Stevens STN climbed 5/8 to 44-7/8, and Fieldcrest Cannon Inc FLD, the result of a merger of Fieldcrest and Cannon, rose 1-1/8 to 39-3/4. West Point-Pepperell Inc WPM rose 1-7/8 to 67-1/8.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Industry	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Automotive_industry	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Burlington,_Vermont	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Recording_Industry_Association_of_America	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Video_game_industry	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Music_industry	http://dbpedia.org/resource/British_Phonographic_Industry	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Australian_Recording_Industry_Association	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Petroleum_industry	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pharmaceutical_industry	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Film_industry	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Burlington,_Ontario	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Kawasaki_Heavy_Industries	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Burlington,_Iowa	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Chemical_industry	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Arms_industry	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Food_industry	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mitsubishi_Heavy_Industries	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Textile_industry	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Light_industry

Dominion Textile	1189	1205	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dominion_Textile	Dominion Textile Inc considers a published report that it has bought a stake in Burlington Industries Inc and is considering making a joint bid for the company to be a rumor, a company spokesman said. As far as I am concerned and the company is concerned, they are rumors and were not commenting on rumors, spokesman Michel Dufour told Reuters in response to a query. All the information that has been given out publicly is that, yes, Dominion Textile is interested in making an acquisition that big...probably based on that people are starting all sorts of rumors, he said. Dufour said yes when asked whether the report was only a rumor, but said the company was not prepared to comment further. Dominion Textile president and chairman Thomas Bell was out of town and unavailable for comment. Dominion Textile last year made an unsuccesful 104-mln- U.S.-dlr bid for Avondale Mills and has maintained a 120-mln- U.S.-dlr line of credit to be used for an American acquisition. Dufour said the company has been negotiating with many U.S. textile companies but would not say whether Burlington Industries was one of them. Burlingtons stock rose sharply this morning on the report, which said Dominion Textile had joined with U.S. investor Asher Edelman to buy a stake in the company and to consider making a takeover offer. Dominion Textile, which reported operating profit of 11.1 mln Canadian dlrs last year on sales of 926.5 mln dlrs, has repeatedly said it will concentrate on expanding into the U.S. The company has said it plans to diversify into new product and market areas in addition to expanding its textile operations.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Textile	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dominion	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dominion_of_Newfoundland	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Textile_manufacturing	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Old_Dominion_University	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Textile_industry	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Spinning_(textiles)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Spindle_(textiles)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Kings_Dominion	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dominion_of_Ceylon	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dominion_of_Pakistan	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Textile_Bowl	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dominion_of_India	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Textile_arts	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dominion_Lands_Act	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Toronto-Dominion_Bank	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Textile_printing	http://dbpedia.org/resource/The_Dominion_Post_(Wellington)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Stitch_(textile_arts)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dominion_Range
Ashai Shimbun	2084	2097	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Asahi_Shimbun	Senior Japanese officials tomorrow open talks with American trade negotiators in a last-ditch effort to avert new high U.S. tariffs to be imposed on a wide variety of Japanese electronic exports. Makoto Kuroda, vice minister of Japans Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI), is to hold two days of meetings with the Deputy U.S. Trade Representative, Michael Smith, and the Under Secretary of Commerce, Bruce Smart. The new tariffs, to go into effect on April 17, are in retaliation for Japans failure to adhere to an agreement to end dumping semiconductors in world markets at below cost and to open its home market to U.S. semiconductor shipments. They are to be imposed on goods which use semiconductors, including television and audio equipment and computers. Both U.S. and Japanese officials have said there was little likelihood the talks would do anything to avert the 100 pct duties on 300 mln dlrs worth of Japanese shipments. President Reagan announced the planned tariffs on March 27 after he said that close monitoring of the July 1986 U.S.-Japanese semiconductor pact convinced U.S. officials that Japan was not honoring the agreement. In making the annoucement, Reagan said I am committed to the full enforcement of our trade agreements designed to provide American industry with free and fair trade. Trade analysts said his move was aimed as much at Japans semiconductor trade practices, which are said to have injured the U.S. semiconductor industry, as Congress, which has complained about presidential timidity on trade issues. Congressional Democrats have pledged to enact aggressive trade laws to counter what they contend has been Reagans inaction to redress the growing U.S. trade deficit, which last year reached 169.8 billion dlrs. About one-third of the deficit was with Japan. Reagan said there were recent signs Japan was beginning to adhere to the pact and that was why he was not terminating it. Kuroda said on leaving Tokyo today he had no new proposals but did have an explanation of the semiconductor situation. He told the daily newspaper Ashai Shimbun that Reagans decision was based on inaccurate data and an exaggerated sense of MITIs power to control Japanese traders. The United States has excessive expectations., he said. To stabilize supply-demand relations which have been disrupted by excess inventories since 1985 will take some time. He also said that U.S. firms had not been aggressive enough in trying to sell in the Japanese market.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mainichi_Shimbun	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Yomiuri_Shimbun	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sankei_Shimbun	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Chunichi_Shimbun	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tokyo_Shimbun	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Chugoku_Shimbun	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tokyo_Nichi_Nichi_Shimbun	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hokkaido_Shimbun	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Nishinippon_Shimbun	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Nikkey_Shimbun	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Heimin_Shimbun	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Kobe_Shimbun	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sanyo_Shimbun	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Yamaguchi_Shimbun	http://dbpedia.org/resource/São_Paulo_Shimbun	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Shimbun_Akahata	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Shizuoka_Shimbun	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Nikkan_Kogyo_Shimbun	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Jōmō_Shimbun	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Seikyo_Shimbun
Buenos Aires province	649	670	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Buenos_Aires_Province	Argentine grain producers adjusted their yield estimates for the 1986/87 coarse grain crop downward in the week to yesterday after the heavy rains at the end of March and beginning of April, trade sources said. They said sunflower, maize and sorghum production estimates had been reduced despite some later warm, dry weather, which has allowed a return to harvesting in some areas. However, as showers fell intermittently after last weekend, producers feared another spell of prolonged and intense rain could cause more damage to crops already badly hit this season. Rains in the middle of last week reached an average of 27 millimetres in parts of Buenos Aires province, 83 mm in Cordoba, 41 in Santa Fe, 50 in Entre Rios and Misiones, 95 in Corrientes, eight in Chaco and 35 in Formosa. There was no rainfall in the same period in La Pampa. Producers feared continued damp conditions could produce rotting and lead to still lower yield estimates for all the crops, including soybean. However, as the lands began drying later in the week harvesting advanced considerably, reaching between 36 and 40 pct of the area sown in the case of sunflower. Deterioration of the sunflower crop evident in harvested material in Cordoba, La Pampa and Buenos Aires forced yield estimates per hectare to be adjusted down again. The seasons sunflowerseed production is now forecast at 2.1 mln to 2.3 mln tonnes, against 2.2 mln to 2.4 mln forecast last week and down 43.9 to 48.8 pct on the 1985/86 record of 4.1 mln. Area sown to sunflowers was two to 2.2 mln hectares, 29.9 to 36.3 pct below the record 3.14 mln hectares last season. Maize harvesting has also reached 36 to 40 pct of the area sown. It is near completion in Cordoba and Santa Fe and will begin in La Pampa and southern Buenos Aires later in April. Production estimates for maize were down from last week at 9.5 mln to 9.8 mln tonnes, against 9.6 mln to 9.9 mln estimated previously. This is 22.2 to 23.4 pct below the 12.4 mln to 12.6 mln tonnes estimated by private sources for the 1985/86 crop and 21.9 to 25.8 pct down on the official figure of 12.8 mln tonnes. Maize was sown on 3.58 mln to 3.78 mln hectares, two to seven pct down on last seasons 3.85 mln. Sorghum was harvested on 23 to 25 pct of the area sown in Cordoba, Santa Fe and Chaco. Harvest will start in La Pampa and Buenos Aires in mid-April. The total area sown was 1.23 mln to 1.30 mln hectares, 10.3 to 15.2 pct down on the 1.45 mln sown last season. The new forecast for the sorghum crop is 2.9 mln to 3.2 mln tonnes compared with three mln to 3.3 mln forecast last week, and is 23.8 to 29.3 pct down on last seasons 4.1 mln to 4.2 mln tonne crop. The soybean crop for this season was not adjusted, remaining at a record 7.5 mln to 7.7 mln tonnes, up 4.2 to 5.5 pct on the 7.2 mln to 7.3 mln estimated by private sources for 1985/86 and 5.6 to 8.5 pct higher than the official figure of 7.1 mln. The area sown to soybeans this season was a record 3.7 mln to 3.8 mln hectares, 10.8 to 13.8 pct up on the record 3.34 mln sown in 1985/86. The soybean crop is showing excessive moisture in some areas and producers fear they may discover more damage. Some experimental harvesting was carried out in Santa Fe on areas making up only about one pct of the total crop but details on this were not available. Preparation of the fields for the 1987/88 wheat crop, which will be sown between May and August or September, has so far not been as intense as in previous years.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Provinces_of_Iran	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Buenos_Aires	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Province	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Provinces_of_Turkey	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Kerman_Province	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Fars_Province	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Khuzestan_Province	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Provinces_of_Spain	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mazandaran_Province	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Lorestan_Province	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Gilan_Province	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Kermanshah_Province	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Razavi_Khorasan_Province	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Isfahan_Province	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Provinces_of_Sri_Lanka	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ardabil_Province	http://dbpedia.org/resource/West_Azerbaijan_Province	http://dbpedia.org/resource/East_Azerbaijan_Province	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hormozgan_Province	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Provinces_of_Argentina

Armen	4992	4997	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Garo_H._Armen	Cheap oil feedstocks, the weakened U.S. dollar and a plant utilization rate approaching 90 pct will propel the streamlined U.S. petrochemical industry to record profits this year, with growth expected through at least 1990, major company executives predicted. This bullish outlook for chemical manufacturing and an industrywide move to shed unrelated businesses has prompted GAF Corp (GAF), privately-held Cain Chemical Inc, and other firms to aggressively seek acquisitions of petrochemical plants. Oil companies such as Ashland Oil Inc (ASH), the Kentucky-based oil refiner and marketer, are also shopping for money-making petrochemical businesses to buy. I see us poised at the threshold of a golden period, said Paul Oreffice, chairman of giant Dow Chemical Co (DOW), adding, Theres no major plant capacity being added around the world now. The whole game is bringing out new products and improving the old ones. Analysts say the chemical industrys biggest customers, automobile manufacturers and home builders that use a lot of paints and plastics, are expected to buy quantities this year. U.S. petrochemical plants are currently operating at about 90 pct capacity, reflecting tighter supply that could hike product prices by 30 to 40 pct this year, said John Dosher, managing director of Pace Consultants Inc of Houston. Demand for some products such as styrene could push profit margins up by as much as 300 pct, he said. Oreffice, speaking at a meeting of chemical engineers in Houston, said Dow would easily top the 741 mln dlrs it earned last year and predicted it would have the best year in its history. In 1985, when oil prices were still above 25 dlrs a barrel and chemical exports were adversely affected by the strong U.S. dollar, Dow had profits of 58 mln dlrs. I believe the entire chemical industry is headed for a record year or close to it, Oreffice said. GAF chairman Samuel Heyman estimated that the U.S. chemical industry would report a 20 pct gain in profits during 1987. Last year, the domestic industry earned a total of 13 billion dlrs, a 54 pct leap from 1985. The turn in the fortunes of the once-sickly chemical industry has been brought about by a combination of luck and planning, said Paces John Dosher. Dosher said last years fall in oil prices made feedstocks dramatically cheaper and at the same time the American dollar was weakening against foreign currencies. That helped boost U.S. chemical exports. Also helping to bring supply and demand into balance has been the gradual market absorption of the extra chemical manufacturing capacity created by Middle Eastern oil producers in the early 1980s. Finally, virtually all major U.S. chemical manufacturers have embarked on an extensive corporate restructuring program to mothball inefficient plants, trim the payroll and eliminate unrelated businesses. The restructuring touched off a flurry of friendly and hostile takeover attempts. GAF, which made an unsuccessful attempt in 1985 to acquire Union Carbide Corp UK, recently offered three billion dlrs for Borg Warner Corp BOR, a Chicago manufacturer of plastics and chemicals. Another industry powerhouse, W.R. Grace (GRA) has divested its retailing, restaurant and fertilizer businesses to raise cash for chemical acquisitions. But some experts worry that the chemical industry may be headed for trouble if companies continue turning their back on the manufacturing of staple petrochemical commodities, such as ethylene, in favor of more profitable specialty chemicals that are custom-designed for a small group of buyers. Companies like DuPont (DD) and Monsanto Co MTC spent the past two or three years trying to get out of the commodity chemical business in reaction to how badly the market had deteriorated, Dosher said. But I think they will eventually kill the margins on the profitable chemicals in the niche market. Some top chemical executives share the concern. The challenge for our industry is to keep from getting carried away and repeating past mistakes, GAFs Heyman cautioned. The shift from commodity chemicals may be ill-advised. Specialty businesses do not stay special long. Houston-based Cain Chemical, created this month by the Sterling investment banking group, believes it can generate 700 mln dlrs in annual sales by bucking the industry trend. Chairman Gordon Cain, who previously led a leveraged buyout of Duponts Conoco Incs chemical business, has spent 1.1 billion dlrs since January to buy seven petrochemical plants along the Texas Gulf Coast. The plants produce only basic commodity petrochemicals that are the building blocks of specialty products. This kind of commodity chemical business will never be a glamorous, high-margin business, Cain said, adding that demand is expected to grow by about three pct annually. Garo Armen, an analyst with Dean Witter Reynolds, said chemical makers have also benefitted by increasing demand for plastics as prices become more competitive with aluminum, wood and steel products. Armen estimated the upturn in the chemical business could last as long as four or five years, provided the U.S. economy continues its modest rate of growth.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Armen_Takhtajan	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Armen_Dzhigarkhanyan	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Margaret_Armen	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Armen_Nazaryan	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Armen_Tigranian	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Armen_Keteyian	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Armen_Vardanyan	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Armen_Alchian	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Armen_Garo	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Armen_Petrosyan	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Armen_Donelian	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Armen_Grigoryan	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Armen_Martirosyan_(athlete)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Armen,_Albania	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Armen_Bagdasarov	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Armen_Gilliam	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Armen_Ra	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Armen_Darbinyan	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Kay_Armen	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Armen_Shahgeldyan
Dominion Textiles Inc	341	362	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dominion_Textile	The largest U.S. textile maker focused on its own business as its competitors found merger partners, but now Burlington Industries Inc may have restructured itself into an attractive takeover candidate, analysts said. The takeover spotlight fell today on Burlington, which rose 4-7/8 to 52-7/8 on speculation that investor Asher Edelman and Dominion Textiles Inc of Canada bought an almost five pct stake. A published report said Edelman and Dominion jointly acquired a stake in Burlington and were weighing a takeover offer. Edelman would not comment, and a spokesman for Montreal-based Dominion called the report just rumors. Burlington said it did not know if the report was true. Wall Street professionals said they were not convinced of the story or that Edelman and Dominion would be the victors if Burlington actually came into play. Arbitragers said past comments from Dominion, however, added credence to the speculation. Dominion has said that it was looking for a takeover in the U.S. Last year, Dominion unsuccessfully bid for Avondale Mills and has maintained a 120 mln dlr line of credit to be used for a U.S. acquisition. A Dominion spokesman said Canadas largest textile producer has been negotiating with many U.S. textile companies, but would not say whether Burlington was among them. There have been acquisitions in this area. Its not unusual that someone could be looking at Burlington after the housecleaning theyve done, said Eileen Gormley of Thomson McKinnon. Burlington sold its domestic operations, which made sheets and other linens, to J.P. Stevens and Co Inc for 110 mln dlrs last year. It also has reorganized management, and focused its operations on businesses that would be less affected by foreign competition, Gormley said. Theyve pulled back so as not to be a commodity marketer, said Gormley. She said in moving more heavily into industrial fabrics, Burlington bought C.H. Masland, which supplies carpets and other fabric to the auto industry. In the past, they just spent and never realized the return on the outlays they did make, she said. You look at their record over the year, and I think theyre poised to be more profitable than they had been in the past, Gormley said. She estimated 1987 earnings of 2.50 dlrs per share, up from 2.01 dlrs per share. Some analysts today recommended clients not buy Burlington at its current levels. Edward Johnson of Johnson Redbook said he recommends selling. He said he believes the stock is worth only about 50 dlrs on a takeover basis and about 46 dlrs on an earnings basis. Some arbitragers, however, said takeover values have been placed on the company of 60 to 65 dlrs per share. After Ashers (Edelman) recent history, a lot of people dont find him very credible anymore, said one arbitrager. Another, however, said Edelman succeeds in forcing managements to take steps to enhance shareholder values even if he doesnt win the target company. Edelman was unsuccessful last year in offers for Lucky Stores Inc and Fruehauf Corp. He did succeed in buying Ponderosa Inc. The stocks of other textile makers rose along with Burlington. J.P. Stevens STN climbed 5/8 to 44-7/8, and Fieldcrest Cannon Inc FLD, the result of a merger of Fieldcrest and Cannon, rose 1-1/8 to 39-3/4. West Point-Pepperell Inc WPM rose 1-7/8 to 67-1/8.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Textile	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dominion	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dominion_of_Newfoundland	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Textile_manufacturing	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Old_Dominion_University	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Textile_industry	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Spinning_(textiles)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Spindle_(textiles)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Kings_Dominion	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dominion_of_Ceylon	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dominion_of_Pakistan	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Textile_Bowl	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dominion_of_India	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Textile_arts	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dominion_Lands_Act	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Toronto-Dominion_Bank	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Textile_printing	http://dbpedia.org/resource/The_Dominion_Post_(Wellington)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Stitch_(textile_arts)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dominion_Range
Chaco	2294	2299	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Chaco_Province	Argentine grain producers adjusted their yield estimates for the 1986/87 coarse grain crop downward in the week to yesterday after the heavy rains at the end of March and beginning of April, trade sources said. They said sunflower, maize and sorghum production estimates had been reduced despite some later warm, dry weather, which has allowed a return to harvesting in some areas. However, as showers fell intermittently after last weekend, producers feared another spell of prolonged and intense rain could cause more damage to crops already badly hit this season. Rains in the middle of last week reached an average of 27 millimetres in parts of Buenos Aires province, 83 mm in Cordoba, 41 in Santa Fe, 50 in Entre Rios and Misiones, 95 in Corrientes, eight in Chaco and 35 in Formosa. There was no rainfall in the same period in La Pampa. Producers feared continued damp conditions could produce rotting and lead to still lower yield estimates for all the crops, including soybean. However, as the lands began drying later in the week harvesting advanced considerably, reaching between 36 and 40 pct of the area sown in the case of sunflower. Deterioration of the sunflower crop evident in harvested material in Cordoba, La Pampa and Buenos Aires forced yield estimates per hectare to be adjusted down again. The seasons sunflowerseed production is now forecast at 2.1 mln to 2.3 mln tonnes, against 2.2 mln to 2.4 mln forecast last week and down 43.9 to 48.8 pct on the 1985/86 record of 4.1 mln. Area sown to sunflowers was two to 2.2 mln hectares, 29.9 to 36.3 pct below the record 3.14 mln hectares last season. Maize harvesting has also reached 36 to 40 pct of the area sown. It is near completion in Cordoba and Santa Fe and will begin in La Pampa and southern Buenos Aires later in April. Production estimates for maize were down from last week at 9.5 mln to 9.8 mln tonnes, against 9.6 mln to 9.9 mln estimated previously. This is 22.2 to 23.4 pct below the 12.4 mln to 12.6 mln tonnes estimated by private sources for the 1985/86 crop and 21.9 to 25.8 pct down on the official figure of 12.8 mln tonnes. Maize was sown on 3.58 mln to 3.78 mln hectares, two to seven pct down on last seasons 3.85 mln. Sorghum was harvested on 23 to 25 pct of the area sown in Cordoba, Santa Fe and Chaco. Harvest will start in La Pampa and Buenos Aires in mid-April. The total area sown was 1.23 mln to 1.30 mln hectares, 10.3 to 15.2 pct down on the 1.45 mln sown last season. The new forecast for the sorghum crop is 2.9 mln to 3.2 mln tonnes compared with three mln to 3.3 mln forecast last week, and is 23.8 to 29.3 pct down on last seasons 4.1 mln to 4.2 mln tonne crop. The soybean crop for this season was not adjusted, remaining at a record 7.5 mln to 7.7 mln tonnes, up 4.2 to 5.5 pct on the 7.2 mln to 7.3 mln estimated by private sources for 1985/86 and 5.6 to 8.5 pct higher than the official figure of 7.1 mln. The area sown to soybeans this season was a record 3.7 mln to 3.8 mln hectares, 10.8 to 13.8 pct up on the record 3.34 mln sown in 1985/86. The soybean crop is showing excessive moisture in some areas and producers fear they may discover more damage. Some experimental harvesting was carried out in Santa Fe on areas making up only about one pct of the total crop but details on this were not available. Preparation of the fields for the 1987/88 wheat crop, which will be sown between May and August or September, has so far not been as intense as in previous years.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Gran_Chaco	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Chaco_War	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Resistencia,_Chaco	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Chaco_Culture_National_Historical_Park	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Chaco_Petrolero	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Estadio_Defensores_del_Chaco	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Gran_Chaco_Province	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Chaco_For_Ever	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Chaco_(Paraguay)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Chaco_Wash	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Chaco_eagle	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bermejo_Department,_Chaco	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Chaco_(spider)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Governor_of_Chaco_Province	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Chaco_Open	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Chaco_sanjuanina	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Chaco_tecka	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Chaco_patagonica	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Chaco_socos	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Chaco_earthcreeper
Brazil	211	217	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Brazil	J.P. Morgan and Co Inc said its first-quarter earnings fell by 3.2 pct, largely reflecting its previously announced decision to place on non-accrual status its 1.3 billion dlrs of medium- and long-term loans to Brazil. That decision, spurred by Brazils suspension of interest payments on February 20, reduced the quarters net income by 20 mln dlrs to 226.4 mln dlrs, compared with 233.9 mln in the first three months of 1986. Morgan also reported a loss of 1.8 mln dlrs from securities underwriting and trading, in contrast to a gain of 45.4 mln dlrs in the year-earlier period. In the fourth quarter of 1986, Morgan posted other trading losses of 5.5 mln dlrs because of setbacks in the trading and underwriting of Euromarket securities. Conditions in some sectors of the Euromarket remained difficult last quarter, with floating rate notes suffering heavy price falls, but a spokeswoman was unable to say whether Morgans trading losses were restricted to the Euromarket. On the positive side, Morgan reduced its provision for loan losses to 35 mln dlrs from 70 mln a year earlier. Foreign exchange trading income rose to 82 mln dlrs from 72.6 mln and trust income increased to 95.9 mln dlrs from 75.9 mln. Morgan said other operating income, mainly fees and commissions, rose to 102.2 mln dlrs from 88.4 mln, but net investment securities gains dropped to 43.1 mln from 58.1 mln. Net interest earnings were 490.4 mln dlrs in the first quarter, down from 499.4 mln a year earlier, and net yield fell to 2.79 pct from 3.20 pct. If Brazil had not been placed on non-accrual, which means that interest can be recorded as income only when payments are actually received, net interest earnings would have been 525.9 mln dlrs and net yield 2.99 pct. If Brazil does not resume payments, 1987 net would be cut by 72 mln dlrs, Morgan added. After the provision for loan losses, Morgans allowance for credit losses at the end of March totaled 953 mln dlrs compared with 910 mln at end-1986 and 815 mln a year earlier. It reported net recoveries of six mln dlrs after charge-offs of eight mln, compared with net charge-offs of 49 mln dlrs after recoveries of three mln a year earlier. Excluding Brazil, non-accruing loans at quarters end were 583 mln dlrs, down from 633 mln at end-1986 and 684 mln a year earlier. Non-interest expenses rose to 371.1 mln dlrs from 303.5 mln dlrs, with more than half the increase related to personnel costs, Morgan said.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/States_of_Brazil	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Municipalities_of_Brazil	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Regions_of_Brazil	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Northeast_Region,_Brazil	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Brazil_national_football_team	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Southeast_Region,_Brazil	http://dbpedia.org/resource/South_Region,_Brazil	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ministry_of_Transport_(Brazil)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Time_in_Brazil	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Federal_District_(Brazil)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Colonial_Brazil	http://dbpedia.org/resource/President_of_Brazil	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Workers'_Party_(Brazil)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mesoregions_of_Brazil	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Empire_of_Brazil	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Microregions_of_Brazil	http://dbpedia.org/resource/North_Region,_Brazil	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Central-West_Region,_Brazil	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Football_in_Brazil	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pedro_II_of_Brazil

Kiichi Miyazawa	413	428	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Kiichi_Miyazawa	Top officials of leading industrial nations arrived at the U.S. Treasury main building to begin a meeting of the Group of Five. Officials seen arriving by Reuter correspondents included West German Finance Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg and Bundesbank President Karl Otto Poehl, French Finance Minister Edouard Balladur and his central banker Jacques de Larosiere. Also seen arriving were Japanese Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa and Japans central bank governor Satoshi Sumita and British Chancellor of the Exchequer and central bank governor Robin Leigh Pemberton. There was no immediate sign of Italian or Canadian officials. Monetary sources have said a fully blown meeting of the Group of Seven is expected to begin around 3 p.m. local time (1900 gmt) and last at least until 6 p.m. (2200 gmt), when a communique is expected to be issued. Italian sources said Italian acting Finance Minister Giovanni Goria met Treasury Secretary James Baker last night.

Asher Edelman	323	336	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Asher_Edelman	The largest U.S. textile maker focused on its own business as its competitors found merger partners, but now Burlington Industries Inc may have restructured itself into an attractive takeover candidate, analysts said. The takeover spotlight fell today on Burlington, which rose 4-7/8 to 52-7/8 on speculation that investor Asher Edelman and Dominion Textiles Inc of Canada bought an almost five pct stake. A published report said Edelman and Dominion jointly acquired a stake in Burlington and were weighing a takeover offer. Edelman would not comment, and a spokesman for Montreal-based Dominion called the report just rumors. Burlington said it did not know if the report was true. Wall Street professionals said they were not convinced of the story or that Edelman and Dominion would be the victors if Burlington actually came into play. Arbitragers said past comments from Dominion, however, added credence to the speculation. Dominion has said that it was looking for a takeover in the U.S. Last year, Dominion unsuccessfully bid for Avondale Mills and has maintained a 120 mln dlr line of credit to be used for a U.S. acquisition. A Dominion spokesman said Canadas largest textile producer has been negotiating with many U.S. textile companies, but would not say whether Burlington was among them. There have been acquisitions in this area. Its not unusual that someone could be looking at Burlington after the housecleaning theyve done, said Eileen Gormley of Thomson McKinnon. Burlington sold its domestic operations, which made sheets and other linens, to J.P. Stevens and Co Inc for 110 mln dlrs last year. It also has reorganized management, and focused its operations on businesses that would be less affected by foreign competition, Gormley said. Theyve pulled back so as not to be a commodity marketer, said Gormley. She said in moving more heavily into industrial fabrics, Burlington bought C.H. Masland, which supplies carpets and other fabric to the auto industry. In the past, they just spent and never realized the return on the outlays they did make, she said. You look at their record over the year, and I think theyre poised to be more profitable than they had been in the past, Gormley said. She estimated 1987 earnings of 2.50 dlrs per share, up from 2.01 dlrs per share. Some analysts today recommended clients not buy Burlington at its current levels. Edward Johnson of Johnson Redbook said he recommends selling. He said he believes the stock is worth only about 50 dlrs on a takeover basis and about 46 dlrs on an earnings basis. Some arbitragers, however, said takeover values have been placed on the company of 60 to 65 dlrs per share. After Ashers (Edelman) recent history, a lot of people dont find him very credible anymore, said one arbitrager. Another, however, said Edelman succeeds in forcing managements to take steps to enhance shareholder values even if he doesnt win the target company. Edelman was unsuccessful last year in offers for Lucky Stores Inc and Fruehauf Corp. He did succeed in buying Ponderosa Inc. The stocks of other textile makers rose along with Burlington. J.P. Stevens STN climbed 5/8 to 44-7/8, and Fieldcrest Cannon Inc FLD, the result of a merger of Fieldcrest and Cannon, rose 1-1/8 to 39-3/4.

House Appropriations subcommittee on Treasury, Postal Service and General Government Appropriations	260	359	http://dbpedia.org/resource/United_States_House_Appropriations_Subcommittee_on_Financial_Services_and_General_Government	Office of Management and Budget Director James Miller said President Reagan will reject the tax increase called for in the House Budget Committees 1988 budget proposal which is before the House for a vote today. Its just completely unacceptable, Miller told a House Appropriations subcommittee on Treasury, Postal Service and General Government Appropriations. The plan, drafted by the Democratic-controlled Budget committee, calls for 22 billion dlrs in higher revenues, of which 18 billion would be from new taxes set by the tax-writing committees. The House committees budget proposal includes some increases in federal user fees as well as 18 billion dlrs in taxes. Miller warned that failure to reduce the federal deficit would jeopardize the U.S. economy. If we do not further reduce the deficit... we place this economic expansion that weve had in the last five years at risk, Miller told the subcommittee. The result of any kind of tax increase would be to increase substantially the prospects that the expansion would come to an end, Miller said.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/United_States_House_of_Representatives	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bosnia_and_Herzegovina	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Track_and_field	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Government	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Financial_services	http://dbpedia.org/resource/General_aviation	http://dbpedia.org/resource/House_music	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Government_of_India	http://dbpedia.org/resource/White_House	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Newfoundland_and_Labrador	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Advisory_Committee_on_Antarctic_Names	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Random_House	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Trinidad_and_Tobago	http://dbpedia.org/resource/General_Motors	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Provinces_and_territories_of_Canada	http://dbpedia.org/resource/House_of_Lords	http://dbpedia.org/resource/United_States_Postal_Service	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Municipalities_of_Bosnia_and_Herzegovina	http://dbpedia.org/resource/House_of_Commons_of_the_United_Kingdom	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Castile_and_León

Department of Trade and Industry	169	201	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Department_of_Trade_and_Industry_(United_Kingdom)	Britain intends to negotiate further agreements on international securities regulation to match those now in force with the U.S. And Japan, government sources said. The Department of Trade and Industry said earlier it had concluded a memorandum of understanding with Japans Finance Ministry to swap supervisory and investigatory information. The agreement covers stocks, shares and government bonds, but not commodity futures, whose regulation in Japan does not come under the Finance Ministry. It therefore does not cover some transactions on the London International Financial Futures Exchange and the London commodities and metal exchanges. The DTI said it hoped to seek further understandings with other countries which met in the U.K. Last December. The meeting involved delegates from the U.K., Switzerland, the U.S., Canada, Australia, Hong Kong, Japan, France, West Germany and Holland. Government sources said the deal with Japan completes arrangements linking Tokyo, the U.S. And London. A U.K. Agreement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) was signed last September. Todays agreement will deal with requests for information on a case by case basis, U.K. Government sources said.

Philadelphias Chase Cancer Center	2418	2451	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Fox_Chase_Cancer_Center	Promising new findings in the use of a controversial experimental drug called Interleukin-2 as a cure for cancer will be published in the April 9 issue of the prestigious New England Journal of Medicine, according to a Wall Street analyst who has obtained an advance copy of the magazine. Among interleukins principal U. S. makers are Cetus Corp CTUS, headquartered in Emeryville, Calif., and Immunex Corp IMNX, based in Seattle, Wash. The journal, to be released late today, contains two articles reporting high remission rates several cancer types. The journal also contains a signed editorial concluding that the new results mark a significant milestone in the search for a successful immunotherapy for cancer. Interleukin-2, also known as IL-2, is a substance naturally produced by living cells in the laboratory. The drug is controversial because it was widely praised as a promising cancer treatment in early reports on its effectiveness in late 1985, only to come under criticism a year later for its failure to live up to its promise and due to its ravaging side effects. One of the new studies, conducted by Dr. William West of Biotherapeutics Inc of Franklin, Tenn., is particularly significant because it found far fewer harsh side effects after it changed the way in which the drug is administered. In that study, researchers administered IL-2 to 48 cancer patients and found a 50-pct remission rate for kidney cancers and a 50 pct remission rate for melanoma, a type of skin cancer, according to Prudential-Bache Securities Stuart Weisbrod, who obtained the advance copy of the magazine. For rectal and colon cancer, the researchers found no remissions, but none of the 48 patients treated had side effects serious enough to be placed under intensive hospital care, according to the article. In the second study, whose principal author is Dr. Steven Rosenberg of the National Cancer Institute, researchers administered IL-2 to 157 cancer patients and found a 33 pct remission rate in cancers of the kidney, a 27 pct rate in melanomas and a 15 pct rate in cancers of the colon and rectum. In the National Cancer Institute trials, a total of four patients died, the magazine reported, confirming the harshness of the drugs side effects as originally administered. Perhaps we are at the end of the beginning of the search for successful immunotherapy for cancer, said the editorial, signed by John Durant of Philadelphias Chase Cancer Center. These observations reported by Rosenberg and West surely did not describe successful practical approaches ready for widespread applications in the therapy of cancer patients, the editorial said. On the other hand, if they reflect, as seems possible, a successful manipulation of the cellular immune system, then we may be near the end of our search for a meaningful direction in the immunuotherapy of cancer, the editorial concluded.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cancer	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Center_(basketball)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Breast_cancer	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Lung_cancer	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Prostate_cancer	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pancreatic_cancer	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Center_fielder	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Convention_center	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Colorectal_cancer	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ovarian_cancer	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Goddard_Space_Flight_Center	http://dbpedia.org/resource/National_Center_for_Education_Statistics	http://dbpedia.org/resource/JPMorgan_Chase	http://dbpedia.org/resource/American_Cancer_Society	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Data_center	http://dbpedia.org/resource/National_Cancer_Institute	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Stomach_cancer	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Liver_cancer	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Minor_Planet_Center	http://dbpedia.org/resource/World_Trade_Center_(1973–2001)

The company said shareholders approved the move at the annual meeting in Providence today when the company reported that its first quarter earnings rose to 38.5 mln dlrs, or 73 cts a share, from 31.7 mln dlrs, or 60 cts a share, in the first quarter 1986. J. Terence Murray, chairman and president of Fleet Financial, said, Fleets mortgage banking activities in particular continued to produce signficant income increases (in the first quarter). Murray said Fleets mortgage servicing portfolio reached 22.1 billion dlrs by March 31, including 1.8 billion dlrs purchased in March.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Financial_services	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Financial_Times	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Financial_institution	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Chief_financial_officer	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Financial_endowment	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Financial_market	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Financial_transaction	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Financial_Conduct_Authority	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Financial_Services_Authority	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Financial_regulation	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Financial_capital	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Financial_instrument	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Prudential_Financial	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Financial_Industry_Regulatory_Authority	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Financial_analyst	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Financial_inclusion	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Financial_economics	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Financial_crisis	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Financial_adviser	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Financial_statement

The one month suspension followed consultation with the Sydney Futures Exchange, SFE, which was liaising with Shintoh concerning the open positions of its clients, the CAC said. The South Australian CAC had applied for the appointment of a receiver and manager over the Adelaide office of Shintoh, an associate member of the SFE, the CAC said. Shintohs is the first licence suspended under a Futures Industry Code introduced by Australian states from July 1, 1986, SFE chief executive Les Hosking told Reuters. Asiavest Pty Ltd, a commodities futures trader associated with Shintoh and incorporated in Queensland, was placed in receivership earlier this year, he said.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Frank_Portman	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Voyager's_Return	http://dbpedia.org/resource/The_Kickback_(film)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/A._norvegica	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Henry_Hetherington_Emmerson	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Samson_and_His_Mighty_Challenge	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Parc_des_Princes	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Lupin_Limited	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Taleh,_Mazandaran	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bob_Sessions_(winemaker)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Anti-Grain_Geometry	http://dbpedia.org/resource/World_Trade_Centre_(Toronto)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Saint-Michel-sur-Rhône	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hoàng_Đình_Tùng	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Kyle_Cassidy	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Saskatchewan_Highway_793	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Relentless_(2010_film)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Luis_Santaliz_Capestany	http://dbpedia.org/resource/2016_Sultan_Azlan_Shah_Cup	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Joe_Fratesi
West Germany	869	881	http://dbpedia.org/resource/West_Germany	Britain intends to negotiate further agreements on international securities regulation to match those now in force with the U.S. And Japan, government sources said. The Department of Trade and Industry said earlier it had concluded a memorandum of understanding with Japans Finance Ministry to swap supervisory and investigatory information. The agreement covers stocks, shares and government bonds, but not commodity futures, whose regulation in Japan does not come under the Finance Ministry. It therefore does not cover some transactions on the London International Financial Futures Exchange and the London commodities and metal exchanges. The DTI said it hoped to seek further understandings with other countries which met in the U.K. Last December. The meeting involved delegates from the U.K., Switzerland, the U.S., Canada, Australia, Hong Kong, Japan, France, West Germany and Holland. Government sources said the deal with Japan completes arrangements linking Tokyo, the U.S. And London. A U.K. Agreement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) was signed last September. Todays agreement will deal with requests for information on a case by case basis, U.K. Government sources said. It is not legally binding and comes into force immediately.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Germany	http://dbpedia.org/resource/West_Virginia	http://dbpedia.org/resource/West_Bengal	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Nazi_Germany	http://dbpedia.org/resource/East_Germany	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Municipalities_of_Germany	http://dbpedia.org/resource/West_Africa_Time	http://dbpedia.org/resource/West_Yorkshire	http://dbpedia.org/resource/West_Azerbaijan_Province	http://dbpedia.org/resource/West_Indies	http://dbpedia.org/resource/West_Pomeranian_Voivodeship	http://dbpedia.org/resource/West_Africa	http://dbpedia.org/resource/West_Bank	http://dbpedia.org/resource/West_Sussex	http://dbpedia.org/resource/List_of_counties_in_West_Virginia	http://dbpedia.org/resource/West_Japan_Railway_Company	http://dbpedia.org/resource/West_Midlands_(county)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Districts_of_Germany	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Kanye_West	http://dbpedia.org/resource/West_Java
Celanese	926	934	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Celanese	Hoechst Celanese Corp said it sent propsective customers a confidential report describing its polyester textile fiber facilities in North Carolina and South Carolina. The company did not disclose any prices. The report describes the facilities in Darlington County, S.C., and Fayetteville, N.C., the company said. The report also decribes related manufacturing, marketing, administrative and technical resources that could be made avialable to a buyer. Hoechst Celanese was formed Feb 27 by the merger of Celanese Corp and American Hoechst Corp. The merger took place after an agreement was reached with the Federal Trade Commission that certain domestic polyester textile fiber assets of the combined companies would be divested, it said. Hoechst Celanese said it has the option of divesting either the South Carolina facilities of the former American Hoechst or a package of polyester textile fiber facilities of the former Celanese.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/British_Celanese	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Celanese_Theatre
La Pampa	833	841	http://dbpedia.org/resource/La_Pampa_Province	Argentine grain producers adjusted their yield estimates for the 1986/87 coarse grain crop downward in the week to yesterday after the heavy rains at the end of March and beginning of April, trade sources said. They said sunflower, maize and sorghum production estimates had been reduced despite some later warm, dry weather, which has allowed a return to harvesting in some areas. However, as showers fell intermittently after last weekend, producers feared another spell of prolonged and intense rain could cause more damage to crops already badly hit this season. Rains in the middle of last week reached an average of 27 millimetres in parts of Buenos Aires province, 83 mm in Cordoba, 41 in Santa Fe, 50 in Entre Rios and Misiones, 95 in Corrientes, eight in Chaco and 35 in Formosa. There was no rainfall in the same period in La Pampa. Producers feared continued damp conditions could produce rotting and lead to still lower yield estimates for all the crops, including soybean. However, as the lands began drying later in the week harvesting advanced considerably, reaching between 36 and 40 pct of the area sown in the case of sunflower. Deterioration of the sunflower crop evident in harvested material in Cordoba, La Pampa and Buenos Aires forced yield estimates per hectare to be adjusted down again. The seasons sunflowerseed production is now forecast at 2.1 mln to 2.3 mln tonnes, against 2.2 mln to 2.4 mln forecast last week and down 43.9 to 48.8 pct on the 1985/86 record of 4.1 mln. Area sown to sunflowers was two to 2.2 mln hectares, 29.9 to 36.3 pct below the record 3.14 mln hectares last season. Maize harvesting has also reached 36 to 40 pct of the area sown. It is near completion in Cordoba and Santa Fe and will begin in La Pampa and southern Buenos Aires later in April. Production estimates for maize were down from last week at 9.5 mln to 9.8 mln tonnes, against 9.6 mln to 9.9 mln estimated previously. This is 22.2 to 23.4 pct below the 12.4 mln to 12.6 mln tonnes estimated by private sources for the 1985/86 crop and 21.9 to 25.8 pct down on the official figure of 12.8 mln tonnes. Maize was sown on 3.58 mln to 3.78 mln hectares, two to seven pct down on last seasons 3.85 mln. Sorghum was harvested on 23 to 25 pct of the area sown in Cordoba, Santa Fe and Chaco. Harvest will start in La Pampa and Buenos Aires in mid-April. The total area sown was 1.23 mln to 1.30 mln hectares, 10.3 to 15.2 pct down on the 1.45 mln sown last season. The new forecast for the sorghum crop is 2.9 mln to 3.2 mln tonnes compared with three mln to 3.3 mln forecast last week, and is 23.8 to 29.3 pct down on last seasons 4.1 mln to 4.2 mln tonne crop. The soybean crop for this season was not adjusted, remaining at a record 7.5 mln to 7.7 mln tonnes, up 4.2 to 5.5 pct on the 7.2 mln to 7.3 mln estimated by private sources for 1985/86 and 5.6 to 8.5 pct higher than the official figure of 7.1 mln. The area sown to soybeans this season was a record 3.7 mln to 3.8 mln hectares, 10.8 to 13.8 pct up on the record 3.34 mln sown in 1985/86. The soybean crop is showing excessive moisture in some areas and producers fear they may discover more damage. Some experimental harvesting was carried out in Santa Fe on areas making up only about one pct of the total crop but details on this were not available. Preparation of the fields for the 1987/88 wheat crop, which will be sown between May and August or September, has so far not been as intense as in previous years.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/La_Liga	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Las_Vegas	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Las_Vegas_Valley	http://dbpedia.org/resource/La_Paz	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pays_de_la_Loire	http://dbpedia.org/resource/La_Scala	http://dbpedia.org/resource/La_Rioja_(Spain)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/La_Rochelle	http://dbpedia.org/resource/La_Paz_Department_(Bolivia)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/La_Plata	http://dbpedia.org/resource/La_Spezia	http://dbpedia.org/resource/LA_Weekly	http://dbpedia.org/resource/La_Crosse,_Wisconsin	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Las_Vegas_Strip	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Las_Palmas	http://dbpedia.org/resource/La_bohème	http://dbpedia.org/resource/La_traviata	http://dbpedia.org/resource/La_Trobe_University	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Estudiantes_de_La_Plata	http://dbpedia.org/resource/La_Libertad_Region
Houston	1319	1326	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Houston	Cheap oil feedstocks, the weakened U.S. dollar and a plant utilization rate approaching 90 pct will propel the streamlined U.S. petrochemical industry to record profits this year, with growth expected through at least 1990, major company executives predicted. This bullish outlook for chemical manufacturing and an industrywide move to shed unrelated businesses has prompted GAF Corp (GAF), privately-held Cain Chemical Inc, and other firms to aggressively seek acquisitions of petrochemical plants. Oil companies such as Ashland Oil Inc (ASH), the Kentucky-based oil refiner and marketer, are also shopping for money-making petrochemical businesses to buy. I see us poised at the threshold of a golden period, said Paul Oreffice, chairman of giant Dow Chemical Co (DOW), adding, Theres no major plant capacity being added around the world now. The whole game is bringing out new products and improving the old ones. Analysts say the chemical industrys biggest customers, automobile manufacturers and home builders that use a lot of paints and plastics, are expected to buy quantities this year. U.S. petrochemical plants are currently operating at about 90 pct capacity, reflecting tighter supply that could hike product prices by 30 to 40 pct this year, said John Dosher, managing director of Pace Consultants Inc of Houston. Demand for some products such as styrene could push profit margins up by as much as 300 pct, he said. Oreffice, speaking at a meeting of chemical engineers in Houston, said Dow would easily top the 741 mln dlrs it earned last year and predicted it would have the best year in its history. In 1985, when oil prices were still above 25 dlrs a barrel and chemical exports were adversely affected by the strong U.S. dollar, Dow had profits of 58 mln dlrs. I believe the entire chemical industry is headed for a record year or close to it, Oreffice said. GAF chairman Samuel Heyman estimated that the U.S. chemical industry would report a 20 pct gain in profits during 1987. Last year, the domestic industry earned a total of 13 billion dlrs, a 54 pct leap from 1985. The turn in the fortunes of the once-sickly chemical industry has been brought about by a combination of luck and planning, said Paces John Dosher. Dosher said last years fall in oil prices made feedstocks dramatically cheaper and at the same time the American dollar was weakening against foreign currencies. That helped boost U.S. chemical exports. Also helping to bring supply and demand into balance has been the gradual market absorption of the extra chemical manufacturing capacity created by Middle Eastern oil producers in the early 1980s. Finally, virtually all major U.S. chemical manufacturers have embarked on an extensive corporate restructuring program to mothball inefficient plants, trim the payroll and eliminate unrelated businesses. The restructuring touched off a flurry of friendly and hostile takeover attempts. GAF, which made an unsuccessful attempt in 1985 to acquire Union Carbide Corp UK, recently offered three billion dlrs for Borg Warner Corp BOR, a Chicago manufacturer of plastics and chemicals. Another industry powerhouse, W.R. Grace (GRA) has divested its retailing, restaurant and fertilizer businesses to raise cash for chemical acquisitions. But some experts worry that the chemical industry may be headed for trouble if companies continue turning their back on the manufacturing of staple petrochemical commodities, such as ethylene, in favor of more profitable specialty chemicals that are custom-designed for a small group of buyers. Companies like DuPont (DD) and Monsanto Co MTC spent the past two or three years trying to get out of the commodity chemical business in reaction to how badly the market had deteriorated, Dosher said. But I think they will eventually kill the margins on the profitable chemicals in the niche market. Some top chemical executives share the concern. The challenge for our industry is to keep from getting carried away and repeating past mistakes, GAFs Heyman cautioned. The shift from commodity chemicals may be ill-advised. Specialty businesses do not stay special long. Houston-based Cain Chemical, created this month by the Sterling investment banking group, believes it can generate 700 mln dlrs in annual sales by bucking the industry trend. Chairman Gordon Cain, who previously led a leveraged buyout of Duponts Conoco Incs chemical business, has spent 1.1 billion dlrs since January to buy seven petrochemical plants along the Texas Gulf Coast. The plants produce only basic commodity petrochemicals that are the building blocks of specialty products. This kind of commodity chemical business will never be a glamorous, high-margin business, Cain said, adding that demand is expected to grow by about three pct annually. Garo Armen, an analyst with Dean Witter Reynolds, said chemical makers have also benefitted by increasing demand for plastics as prices become more competitive with aluminum, wood and steel products. Armen estimated the upturn in the chemical business could last as long as four or five years, provided the U.S. economy continues its modest rate of growth.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Houston_Astros	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Houston_Texans	http://dbpedia.org/resource/University_of_Houston	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Whitney_Houston	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Houston_Chronicle	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Houston_Rockets	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Houston_Dynamo	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Greater_Houston	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sam_Houston	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Downtown_Houston	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Houston_Comets	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Houston_Press	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Houston_Cougars_football	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Houston_County,_Texas	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Houston_Independent_School_District	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sam_Houston_State_University	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Fort_Sam_Houston	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Museum_of_Fine_Arts,_Houston	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Houston_Grand_Opera	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Houston_Aeros_(WHA)

Georgia power	992	1005	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Georgia_Power	An audit submitted to the Georgia Public Service Commission claims that between 944 mln dlrs and 1.8 billion dlrs of the costs of the Plant Vogtle nuclear power station should be disallowed, a Southern Co spokeswoman said. Southerns Georgia Power Co subsidiary has a 45.7 pct interest in the plant and estimated earlier this year it would cost a total of 8.87 billion dlrs. Last year, the plants owners pledged to Georgia regulators they would limit the cost passed on to rate payers to 8.4 billion dlrs. The Southern spokeswoman said the company feels the report by OBrien-Kreitzberg is flawed and biased. She said the report was released yesterday by the state attorney general. Responding to the report today, Georgia Power Chairman Robert W. Scherer told a news conference the conclusions drawn by the firm are not only wrong -- they also reflect the same bias against nuclear power that these auditors have demonstrated in similar cases accross the country. Saying he was not suggesting Georgia power was without fault, Scherer said the audit identified several things I wish we had done differently. Scherer pointed out a report OBrien-Kreitzberg submitted to Georgia regulators in March 1986 projected Georgia Power would not finish Plant Vogtle unit one before the end of 1987. Noting unit one is finished, and we expect it to be in commercial operationg by June, he said the firms latest report ignored the earlier projection, gave the utility no credit for the completion and actually penalized us by suggesting that costs to maintain t he schedule be disallowed. Scherer said the latest audit alleges Georgia Power could have saved 95 mln dlrs if it had stopped using four shifts, seven days a week to speed construction three years sooner. He said this would have delayed completion of the plant for another year and it would have cost several hunderd million dlrs more. Noting the audit said costs were increased 600 mln dlrs by schedule delays totaling 20.5 months, he said First, we have the best concrete placement record in the industry, Second new government regulations after the Three Mile Island incident significantly increased construction time.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Georgia_(country)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Georgia_(U.S._state)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Power_metal	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Savannah,_Georgia	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Power_pop	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Power_forward_(basketball)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/University_of_Georgia	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Athens,_Georgia	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Macon,_Georgia	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Augusta,_Georgia	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Columbus,_Georgia	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Nuclear_power	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Power_station	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Georgia_Institute_of_Technology	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Solar_power	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Axis_powers	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Wind_power	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Marietta,_Georgia	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Electric_power	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Effective_radiated_power
Japan	1808	1813	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Japan	Senior Japanese officials tomorrow open talks with American trade negotiators in a last-ditch effort to avert new high U.S. tariffs to be imposed on a wide variety of Japanese electronic exports. Makoto Kuroda, vice minister of Japans Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI), is to hold two days of meetings with the Deputy U.S. Trade Representative, Michael Smith, and the Under Secretary of Commerce, Bruce Smart. The new tariffs, to go into effect on April 17, are in retaliation for Japans failure to adhere to an agreement to end dumping semiconductors in world markets at below cost and to open its home market to U.S. semiconductor shipments. They are to be imposed on goods which use semiconductors, including television and audio equipment and computers. Both U.S. and Japanese officials have said there was little likelihood the talks would do anything to avert the 100 pct duties on 300 mln dlrs worth of Japanese shipments. President Reagan announced the planned tariffs on March 27 after he said that close monitoring of the July 1986 U.S.-Japanese semiconductor pact convinced U.S. officials that Japan was not honoring the agreement. In making the annoucement, Reagan said I am committed to the full enforcement of our trade agreements designed to provide American industry with free and fair trade. Trade analysts said his move was aimed as much at Japans semiconductor trade practices, which are said to have injured the U.S. semiconductor industry, as Congress, which has complained about presidential timidity on trade issues. Congressional Democrats have pledged to enact aggressive trade laws to counter what they contend has been Reagans inaction to redress the growing U.S. trade deficit, which last year reached 169.8 billion dlrs. About one-third of the deficit was with Japan. Reagan said there were recent signs Japan was beginning to adhere to the pact and that was why he was not terminating it. Kuroda said on leaving Tokyo today he had no new proposals but did have an explanation of the semiconductor situation. He told the daily newspaper Ashai Shimbun that Reagans decision was based on inaccurate data and an exaggerated sense of MITIs power to control Japanese traders. The United States has excessive expectations., he said. To stabilize supply-demand relations which have been disrupted by excess inventories since 1985 will take some time. He also said that U.S. firms had not been aggressive enough in trying to sell in the Japanese market.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/East_Japan_Railway_Company	http://dbpedia.org/resource/West_Japan_Railway_Company	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Empire_of_Japan	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Japan_Football_League	http://dbpedia.org/resource/List_of_towns_in_Japan	http://dbpedia.org/resource/National_highways_of_Japan	http://dbpedia.org/resource/List_of_railway_stations_in_Japan	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Districts_of_Japan	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Liberal_Democratic_Party_(Japan)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Municipalities_of_Japan	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cinema_of_Japan	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Japan_national_football_team	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Japan_Hot_100	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sea_of_Japan	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Prefectures_of_Japan	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Central_Japan_Railway_Company	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Japan_Standard_Time	http://dbpedia.org/resource/King_Records_(Japan)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cities_of_Japan	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Surrender_of_Japan
Britain	0	7	http://dbpedia.org/resource/United_Kingdom	Britain intends to negotiate further agreements on international securities regulation to match those now in force with the U.S. And Japan, government sources said. The Department of Trade and Industry said earlier it had concluded a memorandum of understanding with Japans Finance Ministry to swap supervisory and investigatory information. The agreement covers stocks, shares and government bonds, but not commodity futures, whose regulation in Japan does not come under the Finance Ministry. It therefore does not cover some transactions on the London International Financial Futures Exchange and the London commodities and metal exchanges. The DTI said it hoped to seek further understandings with other countries which met in the U.K. Last December. The meeting involved delegates from the U.K., Switzerland, the U.S., Canada, Australia, Hong Kong, Japan, France, West Germany and Holland. Government sources said the deal with Japan completes arrangements linking Tokyo, the U.S. And London. A U.K. Agreement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) was signed last September. Todays agreement will deal with requests for information on a case by case basis, U.K. Government sources said. It is not legally binding and comes into force immediately.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/United_Kingdom_of_Great_Britain_and_Ireland	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Kingdom_of_Great_Britain	http://dbpedia.org/resource/United_Methodist_Church_(Great_Britain)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Roman_client_kingdoms_in_Britain	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Declarations_of_war_by_Great_Britain_and_the_United_Kingdom	http://dbpedia.org/resource/List_of_Ambassadors_of_France_to_the_Kingdom_of_Great_Britain	http://dbpedia.org/resource/United_Rubber_Workers_of_Great_Britain	http://dbpedia.org/resource/List_of_years_in_the_United_Kingdom_of_Great_Britain_and_Northern_Ireland	http://dbpedia.org/resource/List_of_coats_of_arms_of_the_Prime_Ministers_of_Great_Britain_and_the_United_Kingdom	http://dbpedia.org/resource/The_Late_War_between_the_United_States_and_Great_Britain	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Convention_Between_the_United_States_and_Great_Britain_(1930)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/United_Cut_Nail_Makers_of_Great_Britain_Protection_Society	http://dbpedia.org/resource/List_of_wars_in_Great_Britain	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Great_Britain_at_the_1972_Summer_Paralympics	http://dbpedia.org/resource/National_Youth_Orchestra_of_Great_Britain	http://dbpedia.org/resource/List_of_the_vascular_plants_of_Britain_and_Ireland_3	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hindu_Forum_of_Britain	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Fighter:_The_True_Story_of_the_Battle_of_Britain	http://dbpedia.org/resource/1926–27_New_Zealand_rugby_league_tour_of_Great_Britain	http://dbpedia.org/resource/A112_road_(Great_Britain)

Federal member of parliament for the region,  Charles-Eugene Marin, said last week the federal government is also prepared to provide financial help to restart operations as soon as possible. Noranda has estimated damage from the fire at about 10 mln dlrs and a company spokesman said it should have a more specific estimate by the end of the month. Noranda said it had hoped to have an estimate sooner, but has found that it will take longer than expected to gain access to the burned-out area. Noranda said the mine was not insured.  said the mine was not insured.

New England Journal of Medicine	171	202	http://dbpedia.org/resource/The_New_England_Journal_of_Medicine	Promising new findings in the use of a controversial experimental drug called Interleukin-2 as a cure for cancer will be published in the April 9 issue of the prestigious New England Journal of Medicine, according to a Wall Street analyst who has obtained an advance copy of the magazine. Among interleukins principal U. S. makers are Cetus Corp CTUS, headquartered in Emeryville, Calif., and Immunex Corp IMNX, based in Seattle, Wash. The journal, to be released late today, contains two articles reporting high remission rates several cancer types. The journal also contains a signed editorial concluding that the new results mark a significant milestone in the search for a successful immunotherapy for cancer. Interleukin-2, also known as IL-2, is a substance naturally produced by living cells in the laboratory. The drug is controversial because it was widely praised as a promising cancer treatment in early reports on its effectiveness in late 1985, only to come under criticism a year later for its failure to live up to its promise and due to its ravaging side effects. One of the new studies, conducted by Dr. William West of Biotherapeutics Inc of Franklin, Tenn., is particularly significant because it found far fewer harsh side effects after it changed the way in which the drug is administered. In that study, researchers administered IL-2 to 48 cancer patients and found a 50-pct remission rate for kidney cancers and a 50 pct remission rate for melanoma, a type of skin cancer, according to Prudential-Bache Securities Stuart Weisbrod, who obtained the advance copy of the magazine. For rectal and colon cancer, the researchers found no remissions, but none of the 48 patients treated had side effects serious enough to be placed under intensive hospital care, according to the article. In the second study, whose principal author is Dr. Steven Rosenberg of the National Cancer Institute, researchers administered IL-2 to 157 cancer patients and found a 33 pct remission rate in cancers of the kidney, a 27 pct rate in melanomas and a 15 pct rate in cancers of the colon and rectum. In the National Cancer Institute trials, a total of four patients died, the magazine reported, confirming the harshness of the drugs side effects as originally administered. Perhaps we are at the end of the beginning of the search for successful immunotherapy for cancer, said the editorial, signed by John Durant of Philadelphias Chase Cancer Center. These observations reported by Rosenberg and West surely did not describe successful practical approaches ready for widespread applications in the therapy of cancer patients, the editorial said. On the other hand, if they reflect, as seems possible, a successful manipulation of the cellular immune system, then we may be near the end of our search for a meaningful direction in the immunuotherapy of cancer, the editorial concluded.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/England	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Provinces_of_Iran	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Counties_of_Iran	http://dbpedia.org/resource/National_Register_of_Historic_Places	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Departments_of_France	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Communes_of_France	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Voivodeships_of_Poland	http://dbpedia.org/resource/New_Zealand	http://dbpedia.org/resource/New_York_City	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Political_divisions_of_the_United_States	http://dbpedia.org/resource/List_of_sovereign_states	http://dbpedia.org/resource/New_Jersey	http://dbpedia.org/resource/The_New_York_Times	http://dbpedia.org/resource/New_South_Wales	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Administrative_divisions_of_Azerbaijan	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Republic_of_Ireland	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Provinces_of_Turkey	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Church_of_England	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Regions_of_France	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Parliament_of_England
Georgia Power	1612	1625	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Georgia_Power	An audit submitted to the Georgia Public Service Commission claims that between 944 mln dlrs and 1.8 billion dlrs of the costs of the Plant Vogtle nuclear power station should be disallowed, a Southern Co spokeswoman said. Southerns Georgia Power Co subsidiary has a 45.7 pct interest in the plant and estimated earlier this year it would cost a total of 8.87 billion dlrs. Last year, the plants owners pledged to Georgia regulators they would limit the cost passed on to rate payers to 8.4 billion dlrs. The Southern spokeswoman said the company feels the report by OBrien-Kreitzberg is flawed and biased. She said the report was released yesterday by the state attorney general. Responding to the report today, Georgia Power Chairman Robert W. Scherer told a news conference the conclusions drawn by the firm are not only wrong -- they also reflect the same bias against nuclear power that these auditors have demonstrated in similar cases accross the country. Saying he was not suggesting Georgia power was without fault, Scherer said the audit identified several things I wish we had done differently.

But he said the situation was greatly different now. If you look at the differences between the treasury market now and in the Carter administration years, it is a much more global market now, the official said. There was not the same ease then for the holder of another currency to buy other countries securities, he added, But there is no difficulty now for them to purchase dollars and buy U.S. securities.

Brazil	1748	1754	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Brazil	J.P. Morgan and Co Inc said its first-quarter earnings fell by 3.2 pct, largely reflecting its previously announced decision to place on non-accrual status its 1.3 billion dlrs of medium- and long-term loans to Brazil. That decision, spurred by Brazils suspension of interest payments on February 20, reduced the quarters net income by 20 mln dlrs to 226.4 mln dlrs, compared with 233.9 mln in the first three months of 1986. Morgan also reported a loss of 1.8 mln dlrs from securities underwriting and trading, in contrast to a gain of 45.4 mln dlrs in the year-earlier period. In the fourth quarter of 1986, Morgan posted other trading losses of 5.5 mln dlrs because of setbacks in the trading and underwriting of Euromarket securities. Conditions in some sectors of the Euromarket remained difficult last quarter, with floating rate notes suffering heavy price falls, but a spokeswoman was unable to say whether Morgans trading losses were restricted to the Euromarket. On the positive side, Morgan reduced its provision for loan losses to 35 mln dlrs from 70 mln a year earlier. Foreign exchange trading income rose to 82 mln dlrs from 72.6 mln and trust income increased to 95.9 mln dlrs from 75.9 mln. Morgan said other operating income, mainly fees and commissions, rose to 102.2 mln dlrs from 88.4 mln, but net investment securities gains dropped to 43.1 mln from 58.1 mln. Net interest earnings were 490.4 mln dlrs in the first quarter, down from 499.4 mln a year earlier, and net yield fell to 2.79 pct from 3.20 pct. If Brazil had not been placed on non-accrual, which means that interest can be recorded as income only when payments are actually received, net interest earnings would have been 525.9 mln dlrs and net yield 2.99 pct. If Brazil does not resume payments, 1987 net would be cut by 72 mln dlrs, Morgan added. After the provision for loan losses, Morgans allowance for credit losses at the end of March totaled 953 mln dlrs compared with 910 mln at end-1986 and 815 mln a year earlier. It reported net recoveries of six mln dlrs after charge-offs of eight mln, compared with net charge-offs of 49 mln dlrs after recoveries of three mln a year earlier. Excluding Brazil, non-accruing loans at quarters end were 583 mln dlrs, down from 633 mln at end-1986 and 684 mln a year earlier. Non-interest expenses rose to 371.1 mln dlrs from 303.5 mln dlrs, with more than half the increase related to personnel costs, Morgan said.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/States_of_Brazil	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Municipalities_of_Brazil	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Regions_of_Brazil	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Northeast_Region,_Brazil	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Brazil_national_football_team	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Southeast_Region,_Brazil	http://dbpedia.org/resource/South_Region,_Brazil	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ministry_of_Transport_(Brazil)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Time_in_Brazil	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Federal_District_(Brazil)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Colonial_Brazil	http://dbpedia.org/resource/President_of_Brazil	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Workers'_Party_(Brazil)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mesoregions_of_Brazil	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Empire_of_Brazil	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Microregions_of_Brazil	http://dbpedia.org/resource/North_Region,_Brazil	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Central-West_Region,_Brazil	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Football_in_Brazil	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pedro_II_of_Brazil

Burlington Industries	1080	1101	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Burlington_Industries	Dominion Textile Inc considers a published report that it has bought a stake in Burlington Industries Inc and is considering making a joint bid for the company to be a rumor, a company spokesman said. As far as I am concerned and the company is concerned, they are rumors and were not commenting on rumors, spokesman Michel Dufour told Reuters in response to a query. All the information that has been given out publicly is that, yes, Dominion Textile is interested in making an acquisition that big...probably based on that people are starting all sorts of rumors, he said. Dufour said yes when asked whether the report was only a rumor, but said the company was not prepared to comment further. Dominion Textile president and chairman Thomas Bell was out of town and unavailable for comment. Dominion Textile last year made an unsuccesful 104-mln- U.S.-dlr bid for Avondale Mills and has maintained a 120-mln- U.S.-dlr line of credit to be used for an American acquisition. Dufour said the company has been negotiating with many U.S. textile companies but would not say whether Burlington Industries was one of them. Burlingtons stock rose sharply this morning on the report, which said Dominion Textile had joined with U.S. investor Asher Edelman to buy a stake in the company and to consider making a takeover offer. Dominion Textile, which reported operating profit of 11.1 mln Canadian dlrs last year on sales of 926.5 mln dlrs, has repeatedly said it will concentrate on expanding into the U.S. The company has said it plans to diversify into new product and market areas in addition to expanding its textile operations.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Industry	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Automotive_industry	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Burlington,_Vermont	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Recording_Industry_Association_of_America	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Video_game_industry	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Music_industry	http://dbpedia.org/resource/British_Phonographic_Industry	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Australian_Recording_Industry_Association	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Petroleum_industry	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pharmaceutical_industry	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Film_industry	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Burlington,_Ontario	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Kawasaki_Heavy_Industries	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Burlington,_Iowa	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Chemical_industry	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Arms_industry	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Food_industry	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mitsubishi_Heavy_Industries	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Textile_industry	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Light_industry
DSM	217	220	http://dbpedia.org/resource/DSM_(company)	Dutch state-owned chemical firm NV DSM (DSMN.AS), the former Dutch state mines, which today reported a 2.5 pct increase in 1986 net profit to 412 mln guilders, said it was poised to be privatised, possibly next year. DSM chairman Hans van Liemt told journalists We have done our homework. Were ready. It is up to the state now. He said a public sale of 30 pct of DSMs assets in 1988 was not unlikely, but the timing of the sell-off was entirely in the hands of Parliament. Dutch Finance Minister Onno Ruding is known to be a proponent of privatisation, and the centre-right government coalition mentioned plans to privatise DSM in its policy declaration last autumn. Van Liemt would not speculate on a possible market price, but said his company had raised its total 1986 dividend to 98 mln guilders, almost 25 pct of 1986 net profit. We ought to be able to match our German competitors on price earnings ratio, although the Amsterdam bourse generally has a lower ratio than the worlds major exchanges,  he said.

Chicago	3071	3078	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Chicago	Cheap oil feedstocks, the weakened U.S. dollar and a plant utilization rate approaching 90 pct will propel the streamlined U.S. petrochemical industry to record profits this year, with growth expected through at least 1990, major company executives predicted. This bullish outlook for chemical manufacturing and an industrywide move to shed unrelated businesses has prompted GAF Corp (GAF), privately-held Cain Chemical Inc, and other firms to aggressively seek acquisitions of petrochemical plants. Oil companies such as Ashland Oil Inc (ASH), the Kentucky-based oil refiner and marketer, are also shopping for money-making petrochemical businesses to buy. I see us poised at the threshold of a golden period, said Paul Oreffice, chairman of giant Dow Chemical Co (DOW), adding, Theres no major plant capacity being added around the world now. The whole game is bringing out new products and improving the old ones. Analysts say the chemical industrys biggest customers, automobile manufacturers and home builders that use a lot of paints and plastics, are expected to buy quantities this year. U.S. petrochemical plants are currently operating at about 90 pct capacity, reflecting tighter supply that could hike product prices by 30 to 40 pct this year, said John Dosher, managing director of Pace Consultants Inc of Houston. Demand for some products such as styrene could push profit margins up by as much as 300 pct, he said. Oreffice, speaking at a meeting of chemical engineers in Houston, said Dow would easily top the 741 mln dlrs it earned last year and predicted it would have the best year in its history. In 1985, when oil prices were still above 25 dlrs a barrel and chemical exports were adversely affected by the strong U.S. dollar, Dow had profits of 58 mln dlrs. I believe the entire chemical industry is headed for a record year or close to it, Oreffice said. GAF chairman Samuel Heyman estimated that the U.S. chemical industry would report a 20 pct gain in profits during 1987. Last year, the domestic industry earned a total of 13 billion dlrs, a 54 pct leap from 1985. The turn in the fortunes of the once-sickly chemical industry has been brought about by a combination of luck and planning, said Paces John Dosher. Dosher said last years fall in oil prices made feedstocks dramatically cheaper and at the same time the American dollar was weakening against foreign currencies. That helped boost U.S. chemical exports. Also helping to bring supply and demand into balance has been the gradual market absorption of the extra chemical manufacturing capacity created by Middle Eastern oil producers in the early 1980s. Finally, virtually all major U.S. chemical manufacturers have embarked on an extensive corporate restructuring program to mothball inefficient plants, trim the payroll and eliminate unrelated businesses. The restructuring touched off a flurry of friendly and hostile takeover attempts. GAF, which made an unsuccessful attempt in 1985 to acquire Union Carbide Corp UK, recently offered three billion dlrs for Borg Warner Corp BOR, a Chicago manufacturer of plastics and chemicals. Another industry powerhouse, W.R. Grace (GRA) has divested its retailing, restaurant and fertilizer businesses to raise cash for chemical acquisitions. But some experts worry that the chemical industry may be headed for trouble if companies continue turning their back on the manufacturing of staple petrochemical commodities, such as ethylene, in favor of more profitable specialty chemicals that are custom-designed for a small group of buyers. Companies like DuPont (DD) and Monsanto Co MTC spent the past two or three years trying to get out of the commodity chemical business in reaction to how badly the market had deteriorated, Dosher said. But I think they will eventually kill the margins on the profitable chemicals in the niche market. Some top chemical executives share the concern. The challenge for our industry is to keep from getting carried away and repeating past mistakes, GAFs Heyman cautioned. The shift from commodity chemicals may be ill-advised. Specialty businesses do not stay special long. Houston-based Cain Chemical, created this month by the Sterling investment banking group, believes it can generate 700 mln dlrs in annual sales by bucking the industry trend. Chairman Gordon Cain, who previously led a leveraged buyout of Duponts Conoco Incs chemical business, has spent 1.1 billion dlrs since January to buy seven petrochemical plants along the Texas Gulf Coast. The plants produce only basic commodity petrochemicals that are the building blocks of specialty products. This kind of commodity chemical business will never be a glamorous, high-margin business, Cain said, adding that demand is expected to grow by about three pct annually. Garo Armen, an analyst with Dean Witter Reynolds, said chemical makers have also benefitted by increasing demand for plastics as prices become more competitive with aluminum, wood and steel products. Armen estimated the upturn in the chemical business could last as long as four or five years, provided the U.S. economy continues its modest rate of growth.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/University_of_Chicago	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Chicago_Cubs	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Chicago_Bears	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Chicago_Tribune	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Chicago_White_Sox	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Chicago_Blackhawks	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Chicago_Bulls	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Chicago_Sun-Times	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Art_Institute_of_Chicago	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Loyola_University_Chicago	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Chicago_Transit_Authority	http://dbpedia.org/resource/University_of_Chicago_Press	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Chicago_Loop	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Chicago_Reader	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Chicago_(band)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/University_of_Illinois_at_Chicago	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Chicago_River	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Chicago_Symphony_Orchestra	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Chicago_school_(architecture)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Chicago_(musical)

Georgia Public Service Commission	26	59	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Georgia_Public_Service_Commission	An audit submitted to the Georgia Public Service Commission claims that between 944 mln dlrs and 1.8 billion dlrs of the costs of the Plant Vogtle nuclear power station should be disallowed, a Southern Co spokeswoman said. Southerns Georgia Power Co subsidiary has a 45.7 pct interest in the plant and estimated earlier this year it would cost a total of 8.87 billion dlrs. Last year, the plants owners pledged to Georgia regulators they would limit the cost passed on to rate payers to 8.4 billion dlrs. The Southern spokeswoman said the company feels the report by OBrien-Kreitzberg is flawed and biased. She said the report was released yesterday by the state attorney general. Responding to the report today, Georgia Power Chairman Robert W. Scherer told a news conference the conclusions drawn by the firm are not only wrong -- they also reflect the same bias against nuclear power that these auditors have demonstrated in similar cases accross the country. Saying he was not suggesting Georgia power was without fault, Scherer said the audit identified several things I wish we had done differently. Scherer pointed out a report OBrien-Kreitzberg submitted to Georgia regulators in March 1986 projected Georgia Power would not finish Plant Vogtle unit one before the end of 1987. Noting unit one is finished, and we expect it to be in commercial operationg by June, he said the firms latest report ignored the earlier projection, gave the utility no credit for the completion and actually penalized us by suggesting that costs to maintain t he schedule be disallowed.

U.S	724	727	http://dbpedia.org/resource/United_States	Montedison SPA of Italy said net consolidated profit for its Agrimont Group, formed in June 1986, totalled 1.5 billion lire in 1986. Agrimont SPA, the holding company for Montedisons Agro-Industrial businesses, had sales of 810 billion lire and a net profit of about 1.1 billion lire, after amortization costs of 35 billion lire and a 13 billion lire reduction in the value of inventory due to falling market prices, Montedison said. Agrimont, still wholly owned by Montedison, is taking steps to be traded on the Milan exchange, the company said. The company said that 1986 was characterized by an unstable fertlizer market due to the weak dollar and the decline of international prices for products sold in Europe and the U.S where Agrimont operates through its Conserv division. In pesticides and in animal health care products Agrimont maintained its previous level of revenues and market share in 1986, Montedison said. Montedison said it named Ettore dellIsola to the newly created position of president of Agrimont. Montedison also said it named Renato Picco, managing director of Eridania SPA and Gianfranco Ceroni, managing director of Italiana Olii e Sifi, both of whom are members of the the Ferruzzi Groups management board, to Argimonts board of directors. Ferruzzi owns about 40 pct of Montedison, the company said.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/U.S._state	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Georgia_(U.S._state)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/List_of_counties_in_Georgia_(U.S._state)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/List_of_rivers_of_Georgia_(U.S._state)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Supreme_Court_of_Georgia_(U.S._state)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Paleontology_in_Georgia_(U.S._state)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Commonwealth_(U.S._state)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/List_of_U.S._state_songs	http://dbpedia.org/resource/List_of_tallest_buildings_by_U.S._state	http://dbpedia.org/resource/List_of_U.S._state_soils	http://dbpedia.org/resource/List_of_U.S._states_by_elevation	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Miss_Georgia_(U.S._state)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/List_of_U.S._state_flowers	http://dbpedia.org/resource/List_of_U.S._state_birds	http://dbpedia.org/resource/List_of_U.S._state_trees	http://dbpedia.org/resource/U.S._state_constitutional_amendments_banning_same-sex_unions	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Political_party_strength_in_U.S._states	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Flags_of_the_U.S._states	http://dbpedia.org/resource/List_of_National_Historic_Landmarks_in_Georgia_(U.S._state)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/U.S._European_Command_State_Partnership_Program

Getty	729	734	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Getty_Oil	First Boston Corp analyst William Randol recommended the purchase of Texaco Inc today, saying the discount that investors have made in the share price to reflect the ongoing litigation with Pennzoil has been overdone relative to how we expect the case to conclude. Texacos stock rose 1/8 to 34-1/8. On Monday, the stock tumbled four points after the Supreme Court overturned a lower court decision that cut Texacos bond in the 10.3 billion dlr legal dispute with Pennzoil Co PZL to one billion dlrs. Yesterday, a Texas court granted a temporary injunction on the bond issue pending a hearing next week. The current litigation arose from Texacos buyout of Getty Oil Co in 1984. Pennzoil sued, arguing its earlier agreement to buy Getty was binding. Two Texas state courts upheld Pennzoils position. Randol, noting that the stock has suffered a great deal in the two years since the litigation was filed, said we recognize the legal problems but think investors have overdone it. He said the stock is selling at 48 pct of its asset value, and we think it represents a good value at this level.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Getty_Images	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Getty_Center	http://dbpedia.org/resource/J._Paul_Getty_Museum	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Getty_Research_Institute	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Don_Getty	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Getty_Foundation	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Balthazar_Getty	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Keith_Getty	http://dbpedia.org/resource/J._Paul_Getty	http://dbpedia.org/resource/J._Paul_Getty_Trust	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Estelle_Getty	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Getty_Conservation_Institute	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Kristyn_Getty	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Getty_Villa	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Gordon_Getty	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Getty-Dubay	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mark_Getty	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Getty_family	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Getty_Square	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Talitha_Getty

Parana	619	625	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Paraná_(state)	Storage problems with Brazils record grain crop are likely to result in losses of about five mln tonnes, an Agriculture Ministry spokesman said. Ministry spokesman Leonardo Brito, speaking from Brasilia, told Reuters he believed that about five mln tonnes of this years estimated crop of 65 mln tonnes would be lost. He said part of this would be the normal loss inevitable in harvesting, but that most of it would stem from storage problems. Brazil has a storage capacity of 66 mln tonnes, theoretically sufficient for the crop. But Brito said that the storage capacity was badly distributed. The states of Sao Paulo, Parana and Rio Grande do Sul had between them 70 pct of the nations capacity, but were responsible for only 50 to 60 pct of production. The biggest problems are concentrated in the Centre-West growing regions, where rising production has outpaced storage capacity. Brito said the Centre-West, whose crops include soya and maize, had between 30 and 40 pct of the nations grains production but only 20 pct of its storage space. In addition to the poor distribution of storage units, there is the problem that too much of the capacity is geared to storing grain in sacks, while not enough is suitable for storing loose grain, Brito said. Finally, there is a shortage of lorries to transport the crops. The sheer scale of the task in transporting the record crop has been evident from television reports, which have shown enormous queues of lorries waiting outside granaries.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Acanthogonatus_parana	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Parana_Open	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Acraga_parana	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Parana_river_stingray	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Parana,_Punjab	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dihammaphora_parana	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Postplatyptilia_parana	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Paranas,_Samar
Francis Tombs	915	928	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Francis_Tombs,_Baron_Tombs	Demand for shares in state-owned engine maker Rolls Royce Plc is expected to be substantial when the government privatises it at the end of April, Christopher Clark of the groups bankers Samuel Montagu and Sons Ltd said. He told a press conference after the release of an initial prospectus for the float that the issue would be offered to U.K. Institutions, company employees and the general public. As in previous flotations, clawback arrangements would be made if public subscriptions exceeded initial allocations. He declined to say how the shares would be allocated beyond saying that a significant proportion would go to institutions. A decision on what percentage would go to each sector would be made shortly before the sale price was announced on April 28. Minimum subscription would be for 400 shares with payment in two tranches, again a method broadly in line with previous privatisations. Chairman Sir Francis Tombs denied suggestions that Rolls was a stock that should be left to the institutions. He noted that although the aircraft industry was cyclical, Rolls had several operations -- such as spare parts and military equipment -- that evened out the swings. Rolls 1986 research and development expenditure in 1986 was 255 mln stg and could be expected in the future to vary according to changes in turnover. He noted that net research and development expenditure was written off in the year it occurred, a policy that received inadequate recognition in one or two of the more extravagant forecasts of future profits. He made no forecast himself. In 1986, Rolls reported that pretax profit rose 48 pct to 120 mln stg on turnover 12 pct higher at 1.8 billion.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Francis_Walker_(entomologist)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pope_Francis	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tomb	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Francis_turbine	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Francis_Bacon	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Taylor_&_Francis	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Francis_of_Assisi	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Francis_I_of_France	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Francis_Drake	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Francis_Ford_Coppola	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Francis_Poulenc	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Francis_Xavier	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Connie_Francis	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Francis_Day	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Francis_Buchanan-Hamilton	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Paul_Francis_Webster	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Francis_Crick	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Francis_Lai	http://dbpedia.org/resource/St._Francis_Xavier_University	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Francis_Galton
Budget committee	408	424	http://dbpedia.org/resource/United_States_House_Committee_on_the_Budget	Office of Management and Budget Director James Miller said President Reagan will reject the tax increase called for in the House Budget Committees 1988 budget proposal which is before the House for a vote today. Its just completely unacceptable, Miller told a House Appropriations subcommittee on Treasury, Postal Service and General Government Appropriations. The plan, drafted by the Democratic-controlled Budget committee, calls for 22 billion dlrs in higher revenues, of which 18 billion would be from new taxes set by the tax-writing committees. The House committees budget proposal includes some increases in federal user fees as well as 18 billion dlrs in taxes. Miller warned that failure to reduce the federal deficit would jeopardize the U.S. economy. If we do not further reduce the deficit... we place this economic expansion that weve had in the last five years at risk, Miller told the subcommittee. The result of any kind of tax increase would be to increase substantially the prospects that the expansion would come to an end, Miller said.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Advisory_Committee_on_Antarctic_Names	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Village_development_committee	http://dbpedia.org/resource/International_Olympic_Committee	http://dbpedia.org/resource/UK_Antarctic_Place-Names_Committee	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Committee	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Budget	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Central_Committee	http://dbpedia.org/resource/United_States_Senate_Committee_on_the_Judiciary	http://dbpedia.org/resource/National_Olympic_Committee	http://dbpedia.org/resource/United_States_Olympic_Committee	http://dbpedia.org/resource/International_Paralympic_Committee	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Democratic_National_Committee	http://dbpedia.org/resource/United_States_House_Committee_on_the_Judiciary	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Republican_National_Committee	http://dbpedia.org/resource/International_Committee_of_the_Red_Cross	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Judicial_Committee_of_the_Privy_Council	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Political_action_committee	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Scientific_Committee_on_Antarctic_Research	http://dbpedia.org/resource/World_Heritage_Committee	http://dbpedia.org/resource/House_Un-American_Activities_Committee

Dominion	772	780	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dominion_Textile	The largest U.S. textile maker focused on its own business as its competitors found merger partners, but now Burlington Industries Inc may have restructured itself into an attractive takeover candidate, analysts said. The takeover spotlight fell today on Burlington, which rose 4-7/8 to 52-7/8 on speculation that investor Asher Edelman and Dominion Textiles Inc of Canada bought an almost five pct stake. A published report said Edelman and Dominion jointly acquired a stake in Burlington and were weighing a takeover offer. Edelman would not comment, and a spokesman for Montreal-based Dominion called the report just rumors. Burlington said it did not know if the report was true. Wall Street professionals said they were not convinced of the story or that Edelman and Dominion would be the victors if Burlington actually came into play. Arbitragers said past comments from Dominion, however, added credence to the speculation. Dominion has said that it was looking for a takeover in the U.S. Last year, Dominion unsuccessfully bid for Avondale Mills and has maintained a 120 mln dlr line of credit to be used for a U.S. acquisition. A Dominion spokesman said Canadas largest textile producer has been negotiating with many U.S. textile companies, but would not say whether Burlington was among them. There have been acquisitions in this area. Its not unusual that someone could be looking at Burlington after the housecleaning theyve done, said Eileen Gormley of Thomson McKinnon. Burlington sold its domestic operations, which made sheets and other linens, to J.P. Stevens and Co Inc for 110 mln dlrs last year. It also has reorganized management, and focused its operations on businesses that would be less affected by foreign competition, Gormley said. Theyve pulled back so as not to be a commodity marketer, said Gormley. She said in moving more heavily into industrial fabrics, Burlington bought C.H. Masland, which supplies carpets and other fabric to the auto industry. In the past, they just spent and never realized the return on the outlays they did make, she said. You look at their record over the year, and I think theyre poised to be more profitable than they had been in the past, Gormley said. She estimated 1987 earnings of 2.50 dlrs per share, up from 2.01 dlrs per share. Some analysts today recommended clients not buy Burlington at its current levels. Edward Johnson of Johnson Redbook said he recommends selling. He said he believes the stock is worth only about 50 dlrs on a takeover basis and about 46 dlrs on an earnings basis. Some arbitragers, however, said takeover values have been placed on the company of 60 to 65 dlrs per share. After Ashers (Edelman) recent history, a lot of people dont find him very credible anymore, said one arbitrager. Another, however, said Edelman succeeds in forcing managements to take steps to enhance shareholder values even if he doesnt win the target company. Edelman was unsuccessful last year in offers for Lucky Stores Inc and Fruehauf Corp. He did succeed in buying Ponderosa Inc. The stocks of other textile makers rose along with Burlington. J.P. Stevens STN climbed 5/8 to 44-7/8, and Fieldcrest Cannon Inc FLD, the result of a merger of Fieldcrest and Cannon, rose 1-1/8 to 39-3/4. West Point-Pepperell Inc WPM rose 1-7/8 to 67-1/8.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dominion	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dominion_of_Newfoundland	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Old_Dominion_University	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Kings_Dominion	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dominion_of_Ceylon	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dominion_of_Pakistan	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dominion_of_India	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dominion_Lands_Act	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Toronto-Dominion_Bank	http://dbpedia.org/resource/The_Dominion_Post_(Wellington)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dominion_Range	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dominion_Land_Survey	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dominion_Resources	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dominion_Theatre	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dominion_Atlantic_Railway	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Inter_Dominion	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dominion_Enterprises	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dominion_(Star_Trek)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dominion_Astrophysical_Observatory	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dominion_of_New_England
Treasury	915	923	http://dbpedia.org/resource/United_States_Department_of_the_Treasury	Top officials of leading industrial nations arrived at the U.S. Treasury main building to begin a meeting of the Group of Five. Officials seen arriving by Reuter correspondents included West German Finance Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg and Bundesbank President Karl Otto Poehl, French Finance Minister Edouard Balladur and his central banker Jacques de Larosiere. Also seen arriving were Japanese Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa and Japans central bank governor Satoshi Sumita and British Chancellor of the Exchequer and central bank governor Robin Leigh Pemberton. There was no immediate sign of Italian or Canadian officials. Monetary sources have said a fully blown meeting of the Group of Seven is expected to begin around 3 p.m. local time (1900 gmt) and last at least until 6 p.m. (2200 gmt), when a communique is expected to be issued. Italian sources said Italian acting Finance Minister Giovanni Goria met Treasury Secretary James Baker last night. At those talks Baker apparently convinced Goria, who declined to attend the February meeting of the Group of Seven in Paris, that Italy would participate fully in any meaningful decisions.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/United_States_Secretary_of_the_Treasury	http://dbpedia.org/resource/HM_Treasury	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Treasury	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Department_of_the_Treasury_(Australia)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/United_States_Treasury_security	http://dbpedia.org/resource/First_Lord_of_the_Treasury	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Master_of_the_treasury	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Financial_Secretary_to_the_Treasury	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Solicitor_of_the_United_States_Treasury	http://dbpedia.org/resource/State_Treasury	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Treasury_Board	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Overseer_of_the_treasuries	http://dbpedia.org/resource/United_States_Assistant_Secretary_of_the_Treasury	http://dbpedia.org/resource/New_Zealand_Treasury	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Treasury_Islands	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Secretary_to_the_Treasury	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Register_of_the_Treasury	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Parliamentary_Secretary_to_the_Treasury	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Comptroller_of_the_Treasury	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Treasury_stock

Sao Paulo	608	617	http://dbpedia.org/resource/São_Paulo_(state)	Storage problems with Brazils record grain crop are likely to result in losses of about five mln tonnes, an Agriculture Ministry spokesman said. Ministry spokesman Leonardo Brito, speaking from Brasilia, told Reuters he believed that about five mln tonnes of this years estimated crop of 65 mln tonnes would be lost. He said part of this would be the normal loss inevitable in harvesting, but that most of it would stem from storage problems. Brazil has a storage capacity of 66 mln tonnes, theoretically sufficient for the crop. But Brito said that the storage capacity was badly distributed. The states of Sao Paulo, Parana and Rio Grande do Sul had between them 70 pct of the nations capacity, but were responsible for only 50 to 60 pct of production. The biggest problems are concentrated in the Centre-West growing regions, where rising production has outpaced storage capacity. Brito said the Centre-West, whose crops include soya and maize, had between 30 and 40 pct of the nations grains production but only 20 pct of its storage space. In addition to the poor distribution of storage units, there is the problem that too much of the capacity is geared to storing grain in sacks, while not enough is suitable for storing loose grain, Brito said. Finally, there is a shortage of lorries to transport the crops. The sheer scale of the task in transporting the record crop has been evident from television reports, which have shown enormous queues of lorries waiting outside granaries.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/São_Paulo	http://dbpedia.org/resource/São_Paulo_FC	http://dbpedia.org/resource/University_of_São_Paulo	http://dbpedia.org/resource/List_of_state_highways_in_São_Paulo	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Santos,_São_Paulo	http://dbpedia.org/resource/List_of_rivers_of_São_Paulo	http://dbpedia.org/resource/São_Paulo_Metro	http://dbpedia.org/resource/São_Paulo_Art_Biennial	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Paulo_Coelho	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Paulo_Freire	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Paulo_Branco	http://dbpedia.org/resource/São_Paulo_International_Film_Festival	http://dbpedia.org/resource/São_Vicente,_São_Paulo	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Greater_São_Paulo	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Line_1_(São_Paulo_Metro)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Subdivisions_of_São_Paulo	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Line_3_(São_Paulo_Metro)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/São_Sebastião,_São_Paulo	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Americana,_São_Paulo	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Santo_André,_São_Paulo

Brazil	1529	1535	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Brazil	Major cocoa exporters are likely to limit sales in the weeks ahead in an effort to boost world prices, sources close to a meeting of the Cocoa Producers Alliance (CPA) said. The sources said the depressed world market had been one of the main topics discussed in a closed door meeting of the 11-member CPA which began on Monday. They said producers agreed that cutting sales would aid the buffer stock manager of a new international cocoa pact in his effort to support prices. Major cocoa producing and consuming nations agreed operation rules for the buffer stock at a meeting in London last month and the stock manager is expected to enter the market soon. Prices, under the weight of three successive cocoa surpluses, recently fell to the level at which the manager has to buy cocoa under stock rules. The buffer stock aims to keep prices within a pre-set range by buying when prices fall and selling when they rise. The worlds cocoa price at present is just not interesting, commented one delegate representing a major CPA producer. Another source said that with much of the 1986/87 (October-September) world cocoa crop sold, limiting sales in the near term concerns essentially next years harvest. The sources noted, however, that the cocoa industry in Brazil, the worlds number two producer, is in private hands. This means limiting sales is more difficult than in major West African producers, where sales are made or authorized by commodity marketing boards. The CPA includes the worlds top three producers, Ivory Coast, Brazil and Ghana, and accounts for 80 pct of all output. The meeting here is due to end tomorrow evening.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/States_of_Brazil	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Municipalities_of_Brazil	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Regions_of_Brazil	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Northeast_Region,_Brazil	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Brazil_national_football_team	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Southeast_Region,_Brazil	http://dbpedia.org/resource/South_Region,_Brazil	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ministry_of_Transport_(Brazil)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Time_in_Brazil	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Federal_District_(Brazil)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Colonial_Brazil	http://dbpedia.org/resource/President_of_Brazil	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Workers'_Party_(Brazil)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mesoregions_of_Brazil	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Empire_of_Brazil	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Microregions_of_Brazil	http://dbpedia.org/resource/North_Region,_Brazil	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Central-West_Region,_Brazil	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Football_in_Brazil	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pedro_II_of_Brazil

National Cancer Institute	2108	2133	http://dbpedia.org/resource/National_Cancer_Institute	Promising new findings in the use of a controversial experimental drug called Interleukin-2 as a cure for cancer will be published in the April 9 issue of the prestigious New England Journal of Medicine, according to a Wall Street analyst who has obtained an advance copy of the magazine. Among interleukins principal U. S. makers are Cetus Corp CTUS, headquartered in Emeryville, Calif., and Immunex Corp IMNX, based in Seattle, Wash. The journal, to be released late today, contains two articles reporting high remission rates several cancer types. The journal also contains a signed editorial concluding that the new results mark a significant milestone in the search for a successful immunotherapy for cancer. Interleukin-2, also known as IL-2, is a substance naturally produced by living cells in the laboratory. The drug is controversial because it was widely praised as a promising cancer treatment in early reports on its effectiveness in late 1985, only to come under criticism a year later for its failure to live up to its promise and due to its ravaging side effects. One of the new studies, conducted by Dr. William West of Biotherapeutics Inc of Franklin, Tenn., is particularly significant because it found far fewer harsh side effects after it changed the way in which the drug is administered. In that study, researchers administered IL-2 to 48 cancer patients and found a 50-pct remission rate for kidney cancers and a 50 pct remission rate for melanoma, a type of skin cancer, according to Prudential-Bache Securities Stuart Weisbrod, who obtained the advance copy of the magazine. For rectal and colon cancer, the researchers found no remissions, but none of the 48 patients treated had side effects serious enough to be placed under intensive hospital care, according to the article. In the second study, whose principal author is Dr. Steven Rosenberg of the National Cancer Institute, researchers administered IL-2 to 157 cancer patients and found a 33 pct remission rate in cancers of the kidney, a 27 pct rate in melanomas and a 15 pct rate in cancers of the colon and rectum. In the National Cancer Institute trials, a total of four patients died, the magazine reported, confirming the harshness of the drugs side effects as originally administered. Perhaps we are at the end of the beginning of the search for successful immunotherapy for cancer, said the editorial, signed by John Durant of Philadelphias Chase Cancer Center. These observations reported by Rosenberg and West surely did not describe successful practical approaches ready for widespread applications in the therapy of cancer patients, the editorial said. On the other hand, if they reflect, as seems possible, a successful manipulation of the cellular immune system, then we may be near the end of our search for a meaningful direction in the immunuotherapy of cancer, the editorial concluded.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/National_Register_of_Historic_Places	http://dbpedia.org/resource/National_Football_League	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cancer	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Indian_National_Congress	http://dbpedia.org/resource/National_Hockey_League	http://dbpedia.org/resource/National_Basketball_Association	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Massachusetts_Institute_of_Technology	http://dbpedia.org/resource/National_Historic_Landmark	http://dbpedia.org/resource/National_League	http://dbpedia.org/resource/National_Park_Service	http://dbpedia.org/resource/National_park	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Breast_cancer	http://dbpedia.org/resource/National_Institutes_of_Health	http://dbpedia.org/resource/National_Collegiate_Athletic_Association	http://dbpedia.org/resource/National_Science_Foundation	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Lung_cancer	http://dbpedia.org/resource/National_Action_Party_(Mexico)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/National_Topographic_System	http://dbpedia.org/resource/England_national_football_team	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Canadian_National_Railway

VW	257	259	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Volkswagen_Group	Volkswagen AG VOWG.F, VW, is due to make a formal announcement about its 1986 dividend tomorrow after saying the 1985 level of 10 marks per ordinary share would be held, despite massive losses because of a suspected foreign currency fraud. A spokesman said VWs supervisory board will meet tomorrow to discuss the payout. A statement will be made afterwards. VW has also said disclosed profits for 1986 will reach their 1985 level, despite provisions of a possible 480 mln marks linked to the currency affair. The figure is virtually the same as the 477 mln mark 1985 parent company net profit. When VW first confirmed the currency scandal on March 10 it said the management board would propose an unchanged 10-mark dividend to the supervisory board. A dividend of 11 marks would be proposed for the companys new preference shares. Share analysts said they saw supervisory board approval of the management board proposal as virtually a formality. Anything else would be more than a surprise, one said. Company sources said VW would have to dig into reserves to maintain the disclosed profit. Parent company reserves stood at around three billion marks at end-1985.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Better_Half_VW	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cal-Style_VW	http://dbpedia.org/resource/VW_276_Schlepperfahrzeug	http://dbpedia.org/resource/VW_Cephei	http://dbpedia.org/resource/VW_Hydri	http://dbpedia.org/resource/VW_Herald	http://dbpedia.org/resource/VW_Electronics_Research_Laboratory
U.S. National Transportation Safety Board	541	582	http://dbpedia.org/resource/National_Transportation_Safety_Board	Faulty repair work by The Boeing Company BA.N was a contributary cause to a Japan Air Lines Co Ltd JAPN.Y 747 crash on August 12, 1985, that killed 520 people, the final draft of a Ministry of Transport report says. There were only four survivors when the aircraft crashed into a mountain north of Tokyo. The report said inadequate inspection of the aircraft by Japanese inspectors after the repairs was another factor in the crash. The crew were cleared of any responsibility for the disaster. The report, which was sent on March 23 to the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board for comment, should be released in late May. Under an international convention the draft must be submitted for final comments to the relevant authorities. Boeing spokesmen were unavailable for comment. On April 4, a Boeing spokesman at the firms headquarters said the company would probably make no comment on the Japanese investigation teams report until it was officially released. On September 6, 1985, Boeing said in a statement that the 1978 repairs it had undertaken were faulty. This statement did not, however, connect the faulty repairs with the cause of the crash.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/National_Register_of_Historic_Places	http://dbpedia.org/resource/National_Football_League	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Indian_National_Congress	http://dbpedia.org/resource/National_Hockey_League	http://dbpedia.org/resource/National_Basketball_Association	http://dbpedia.org/resource/National_Historic_Landmark	http://dbpedia.org/resource/National_League	http://dbpedia.org/resource/National_Park_Service	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Board_game	http://dbpedia.org/resource/National_park	http://dbpedia.org/resource/National_Collegiate_Athletic_Association	http://dbpedia.org/resource/National_Science_Foundation	http://dbpedia.org/resource/National_Action_Party_(Mexico)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/National_Topographic_System	http://dbpedia.org/resource/England_national_football_team	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Board_of_directors	http://dbpedia.org/resource/CSX_Transportation	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Canadian_National_Railway	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Scotland_national_football_team	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Japanese_National_Railways
Kenneth Kaunda	379	393	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Kenneth_Kaunda	The Zambian government has no immediate plans to follow last weeks increase in the producer price of maize with a hike in the retail price of maize meal, an official of the ruling party said. Last December, a 120 pct increase in the consumer price for refined maize meal, a Zambian staple, led to food riots in which at least 15 people died. That price increase, which President Kenneth Kaunda later revoked, followed pressure by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to reduce the governments subsidy bill. However, if the producer price rise, from 6.10 dlrs to 8.67 dlrs per 90-kg bag, is not accompanied by a retail price increase, the government will have to spend more on subsidies, a practice discouraged by the IMF. There is no way out but to raise the subsidy levels of meal. It (the government) would have to choose between the demands of the IMF and those of the people, a Ministry of Agriculture economist said.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Kenneth_Branagh	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Kenneth_MacMillan	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Kenneth_McClintock	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Kenneth_Carlsen	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Kenneth_Kelly	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Kenneth_Clark	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Kenneth_Williams	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Kenneth_Arrow	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Kenneth_Anger	http://dbpedia.org/resource/John_Kenneth_Galbraith	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Kenneth_Burke	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Kenneth_Clarke	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Kenneth_Rexroth	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Kenneth_Grahame	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Kenneth_Harlan	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Kenneth_Welsh	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Kenneth_Cranham	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Kenneth_Muse	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Kenneth_Tsang	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Kenneth_More
Quebec	129	135	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Quebec	Quebec mines minister Raymond Savoie said the province is prepared to offer money to help re-open (Noranda Inc))'s Murdochville, Quebec copper mine, shut down by fire last week, but said he could not give a specific figure until damage estimates have been completed. Federal member of parliament for the region,  Charles-Eugene Marin, said last week the federal government is also prepared to provide financial help to restart operations as soon as possible. Noranda has estimated damage from the fire at about 10 mln dlrs and a company spokesman said it should have a more specific estimate by the end of the month. Noranda said it had hoped to have an estimate sooner, but has found that it will take longer than expected to gain access to the burned-out area. Noranda said the mine was not insured.  said the mine was not insured. "We decided many years ago...that the costs of insuring all of NorandaNoranda's underground operations would have been prohibitive, underground operations would have been prohibitive," Larry Taylor, NorandaNoranda's risk management and insurance director, said.

Last weeks fire, the company had only had one previous mine accident many years ago. Last week's fire killed one miner and trapped 52 other underground, some for up to 24 hours. It was believed to have started on a new conveyor system. Noranda has said it would take four to five months to return the mine to normal operating capacity. It produced 72,0000 tons of copper anode last year, Coffin said.

Netherlands	164	175	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Netherlands	Roughly half of this years expected 130,000 hectare Dutch sugar beet crop is already in the ground, a spokesman for Suiker Unie, the largest sugar processor in the Netherlands, told Reuters. Conditions are generally good and the average sowing date for the crop is expected to be around April 11, against April 23 last year, and a 10-year average of April 14, the spokesman added. It is far too early yet to say what kind of output we can expect when it comes to harvest in September, but at least the crop is off to a very good start, he said. Last year, the Netherlands planted a record 137,600 hectares of sugar beet and produced a record 1.2 mln tonnes of white sugar, substantially more than the countrys combined A and B quota of 872,000 tonnes. This year, however, a self-imposed quota system has been introduced with the aim of cutting plantings to 130,000 hectares and reducing white sugar output to around 915,000 tonnes to minimise the amount of non-quota C sugar produced. Only farmers with a record of growing suger beet have been allotted quotas. This is expected to prevent the area being boosted by dairy or cereal farmers moving into sugar.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Limburg_(Netherlands)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Netherlands_Antilles	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Provinces_of_the_Netherlands	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Netherlands_national_football_team	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Telephone_numbers_in_the_Netherlands	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Royal_Netherlands_Navy	http://dbpedia.org/resource/List_of_municipalities_of_the_Netherlands	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Southern_Netherlands	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Emmen,_Netherlands	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Spanish_Netherlands	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Labour_Party_(Netherlands)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Kingdom_of_the_Netherlands	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Austrian_Netherlands	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Royal_Netherlands_Academy_of_Arts_and_Sciences	http://dbpedia.org/resource/House_of_Representatives_(Netherlands)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ede,_Netherlands	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Municipal_council_(Netherlands)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Senate_(Netherlands)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Netherlands_national_cricket_team	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Beatrix_of_the_Netherlands

NV DSM	32	38	http://dbpedia.org/resource/DSM_(company)	Dutch state-owned chemical firm NV DSM (DSMN.AS), the former Dutch state mines, which today reported a 2.5 pct increase in 1986 net profit to 412 mln guilders, said it was poised to be privatised, possibly next year. DSM chairman Hans van Liemt told journalists We have done our homework. Were ready. It is up to the state now. He said a public sale of 30 pct of DSMs assets in 1988 was not unlikely, but the timing of the sell-off was entirely in the hands of Parliament. Dutch Finance Minister Onno Ruding is known to be a proponent of privatisation, and the centre-right government coalition mentioned plans to privatise DSM in its policy declaration last autumn. Van Liemt would not speculate on a possible market price, but said his company had raised its total 1986 dividend to 98 mln guilders, almost 25 pct of 1986 net profit. We ought to be able to match our German competitors on price earnings ratio, although the Amsterdam bourse generally has a lower ratio than the worlds major exchanges,  he said. The average Dutch price/earnings ratio is 10.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/DSM-5	http://dbpedia.org/resource/DSM_CC	http://dbpedia.org/resource/DSM-IV_codes	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Structured_Clinical_Interview_for_DSM-IV	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Homosexuality_in_DSM	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Centrum_voor_Gelijkheid_van_Kansen_en_voor_Racismebestrijding_v_Firma_Feryn_NV	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Nikitin_NV-4	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Van_der_Schuyt,_Van_den_Boom_en_Stanfries_NV	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Avial_NV	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Kiwa_NV	http://dbpedia.org/resource/NV_Arena	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Nissan_NV	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Société_anonyme_Cimenteries_CBR_Cementsbedrijven_NV_v_Commission	http://dbpedia.org/resource/NVSS_2146+82	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mutoh_Europe_nv	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Beheermaatschappij_Helling_I_NV_v_Magistrate,_Cape_Town	http://dbpedia.org/resource/NV_(album)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/NV_Ingenieurskantoor_voor_Scheepsbouw	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Proper_Micro_NV	http://dbpedia.org/resource/NV-41_mine
Paris Club	891	901	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Paris_Club	Plans to rejuvenate Polands economy by reducing central government control would help reassure Western creditors that the countrys economy was safe to invest in, a senior Polish official said. The business of granting loans to Poland is not as bad a business as you might imagine, senior Polish government spokesman Jerzy Urban told a news conference in Stockholm. Urban, visiting the Swedish capital to deliver a lecture at the Foreign Policy Institute, announced earlier this week that Poland would soon offer shares to private citizens in state companies in a bid to make the economy more responsive. This was part of a major economic reform to be announced in the coming weeks, he said. Urban said the main problem with his countrys foreign debt burden of 32 billion dollars was short term interest charges but the long term looked more secure. He said he hoped talks under way with the Paris Club, grouping Polands main government creditors, would shortly solve the problem of short term servicing. Urban told reporters that debt servicing was hampering the expansion of the national economy, but that the new plans for economic reform would open new vistas for Polish exports. He criticised the blocking efforts of some Western governments, whom he declined to name, for putting political considerations ahead of economic co-operation. After the lifting of U.S. Sanctions against the Polish economy we considered all political obstacles had been removed, but that has not been the case, Urban said.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Paris	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Melbourne_Football_Club	http://dbpedia.org/resource/St_Kilda_Football_Club	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Fitzroy_Football_Club	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Richmond_Football_Club	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Carlton_Football_Club	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Geelong_Football_Club	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Collingwood_Football_Club	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Essendon_Football_Club	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hawthorn_Football_Club	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Marylebone_Cricket_Club	http://dbpedia.org/resource/University_of_Paris	http://dbpedia.org/resource/The_A.V._Club	http://dbpedia.org/resource/North_Melbourne_Football_Club	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Lancashire_County_Cricket_Club	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sports_club	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Gloucestershire_County_Cricket_Club	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Yorkshire_County_Cricket_Club	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sussex_County_Cricket_Club	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Kent_County_Cricket_Club

U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission	1024	1063	http://dbpedia.org/resource/U.S._Securities_and_Exchange_Commission	Britain intends to negotiate further agreements on international securities regulation to match those now in force with the U.S. And Japan, government sources said. The Department of Trade and Industry said earlier it had concluded a memorandum of understanding with Japans Finance Ministry to swap supervisory and investigatory information. The agreement covers stocks, shares and government bonds, but not commodity futures, whose regulation in Japan does not come under the Finance Ministry.

Miller	246	252	http://dbpedia.org/resource/James_C._Miller_III	Office of Management and Budget Director James Miller said President Reagan will reject the tax increase called for in the House Budget Committees 1988 budget proposal which is before the House for a vote today. Its just completely unacceptable, Miller told a House Appropriations subcommittee on Treasury, Postal Service and General Government Appropriations. The plan, drafted by the Democratic-controlled Budget committee, calls for 22 billion dlrs in higher revenues, of which 18 billion would be from new taxes set by the tax-writing committees. The House committees budget proposal includes some increases in federal user fees as well as 18 billion dlrs in taxes. Miller warned that failure to reduce the federal deficit would jeopardize the U.S. economy. If we do not further reduce the deficit... we place this economic expansion that weve had in the last five years at risk, Miller told the subcommittee. The result of any kind of tax increase would be to increase substantially the prospects that the expansion would come to an end, Miller said.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Arthur_Miller	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Glenn_Miller	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Miller	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Marcus_Miller	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Henry_Miller	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Roger_Miller	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Philip_Miller	http://dbpedia.org/resource/P._Schuyler_Miller	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Barney_Miller	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Gerrit_Smith_Miller	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dennis_Miller	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mac_Miller	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ben_Millers	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Frank_Miller_(comics)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Minneapolis_Millers	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mitch_Miller	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Jonathan_Miller	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ernest_Miller_(cinematographer)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Steve_Miller_Band	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sienna_Miller

Japans Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI),	228	287	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ministry_of_International_Trade_and_Industry	Senior Japanese officials tomorrow open talks with American trade negotiators in a last-ditch effort to avert new high U.S. tariffs to be imposed on a wide variety of Japanese electronic exports. Makoto Kuroda, vice minister of Japans Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI), is to hold two days of meetings with the Deputy U.S. Trade Representative, Michael Smith, and the Under Secretary of Commerce, Bruce Smart. The new tariffs, to go into effect on April 17, are in retaliation for Japans failure to adhere to an agreement to end dumping semiconductors in world markets at below cost and to open its home market to U.S. semiconductor shipments. They are to be imposed on goods which use semiconductors, including television and audio equipment and computers. Both U.S. and Japanese officials have said there was little likelihood the talks would do anything to avert the 100 pct duties on 300 mln dlrs worth of Japanese shipments. President Reagan announced the planned tariffs on March 27 after he said that close monitoring of the July 1986 U.S.-Japanese semiconductor pact convinced U.S. officials that Japan was not honoring the agreement. In making the annoucement, Reagan said I am committed to the full enforcement of our trade agreements designed to provide American industry with free and fair trade. Trade analysts said his move was aimed as much at Japans semiconductor trade practices, which are said to have injured the U.S. semiconductor industry, as Congress, which has complained about presidential timidity on trade issues. Congressional Democrats have pledged to enact aggressive trade laws to counter what they contend has been Reagans inaction to redress the growing U.S. trade deficit, which last year reached 169.8 billion dlrs. About one-third of the deficit was with Japan. Reagan said there were recent signs Japan was beginning to adhere to the pact and that was why he was not terminating it. Kuroda said on leaving Tokyo today he had no new proposals but did have an explanation of the semiconductor situation. He told the daily newspaper Ashai Shimbun that Reagans decision was based on inaccurate data and an exaggerated sense of MITIs power to control Japanese traders. The United States has excessive expectations., he said. To stabilize supply-demand relations which have been disrupted by excess inventories since 1985 will take some time. He also said that U.S. firms had not been aggressive enough in trying to sell in the Japanese market.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Provinces_of_Iran	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Counties_of_Iran	http://dbpedia.org/resource/National_Register_of_Historic_Places	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Departments_of_France	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Communes_of_France	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Voivodeships_of_Poland	http://dbpedia.org/resource/List_of_sovereign_states	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Political_divisions_of_the_United_States	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Administrative_divisions_of_Azerbaijan	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Republic_of_Ireland	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Provinces_of_Turkey	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bosnia_and_Herzegovina	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Regions_of_France	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bachelor_of_Arts	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Municipalities_of_Slovenia	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Track_and_field	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Trade_union	http://dbpedia.org/resource/States_of_Brazil	http://dbpedia.org/resource/University_of_Michigan	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Statistical_regions_of_Slovenia

GAF Corp	375	383	http://dbpedia.org/resource/GAF_Materials_Corporation	Cheap oil feedstocks, the weakened U.S. dollar and a plant utilization rate approaching 90 pct will propel the streamlined U.S. petrochemical industry to record profits this year, with growth expected through at least 1990, major company executives predicted. This bullish outlook for chemical manufacturing and an industrywide move to shed unrelated businesses has prompted GAF Corp (GAF), privately-held Cain Chemical Inc, and other firms to aggressively seek acquisitions of petrochemical plants. Oil companies such as Ashland Oil Inc (ASH), the Kentucky-based oil refiner and marketer, are also shopping for money-making petrochemical businesses to buy. I see us poised at the threshold of a golden period, said Paul Oreffice, chairman of giant Dow Chemical Co (DOW), adding, Theres no major plant capacity being added around the world now. The whole game is bringing out new products and improving the old ones. Analysts say the chemical industrys biggest customers, automobile manufacturers and home builders that use a lot of paints and plastics, are expected to buy quantities this year. U.S. petrochemical plants are currently operating at about 90 pct capacity, reflecting tighter supply that could hike product prices by 30 to 40 pct this year, said John Dosher, managing director of Pace Consultants Inc of Houston. Demand for some products such as styrene could push profit margins up by as much as 300 pct, he said. Oreffice, speaking at a meeting of chemical engineers in Houston, said Dow would easily top the 741 mln dlrs it earned last year and predicted it would have the best year in its history. In 1985, when oil prices were still above 25 dlrs a barrel and chemical exports were adversely affected by the strong U.S. dollar, Dow had profits of 58 mln dlrs. I believe the entire chemical industry is headed for a record year or close to it, Oreffice said. GAF chairman Samuel Heyman estimated that the U.S. chemical industry would report a 20 pct gain in profits during 1987. Last year, the domestic industry earned a total of 13 billion dlrs, a 54 pct leap from 1985. The turn in the fortunes of the once-sickly chemical industry has been brought about by a combination of luck and planning, said Paces John Dosher. Dosher said last years fall in oil prices made feedstocks dramatically cheaper and at the same time the American dollar was weakening against foreign currencies. That helped boost U.S. chemical exports. Also helping to bring supply and demand into balance has been the gradual market absorption of the extra chemical manufacturing capacity created by Middle Eastern oil producers in the early 1980s. Finally, virtually all major U.S. chemical manufacturers have embarked on an extensive corporate restructuring program to mothball inefficient plants, trim the payroll and eliminate unrelated businesses. The restructuring touched off a flurry of friendly and hostile takeover attempts. GAF, which made an unsuccessful attempt in 1985 to acquire Union Carbide Corp UK, recently offered three billion dlrs for Borg Warner Corp BOR, a Chicago manufacturer of plastics and chemicals. Another industry powerhouse, W.R. Grace (GRA) has divested its retailing, restaurant and fertilizer businesses to raise cash for chemical acquisitions. But some experts worry that the chemical industry may be headed for trouble if companies continue turning their back on the manufacturing of staple petrochemical commodities, such as ethylene, in favor of more profitable specialty chemicals that are custom-designed for a small group of buyers. Companies like DuPont (DD) and Monsanto Co MTC spent the past two or three years trying to get out of the commodity chemical business in reaction to how badly the market had deteriorated, Dosher said. But I think they will eventually kill the margins on the profitable chemicals in the niche market. Some top chemical executives share the concern. The challenge for our industry is to keep from getting carried away and repeating past mistakes, GAFs Heyman cautioned. The shift from commodity chemicals may be ill-advised. Specialty businesses do not stay special long. Houston-based Cain Chemical, created this month by the Sterling investment banking group, believes it can generate 700 mln dlrs in annual sales by bucking the industry trend. Chairman Gordon Cain, who previously led a leveraged buyout of Duponts Conoco Incs chemical business, has spent 1.1 billion dlrs since January to buy seven petrochemical plants along the Texas Gulf Coast. The plants produce only basic commodity petrochemicals that are the building blocks of specialty products. This kind of commodity chemical business will never be a glamorous, high-margin business, Cain said, adding that demand is expected to grow by about three pct annually. Garo Armen, an analyst with Dean Witter Reynolds, said chemical makers have also benefitted by increasing demand for plastics as prices become more competitive with aluminum, wood and steel products. Armen estimated the upturn in the chemical business could last as long as four or five years, provided the U.S. economy continues its modest rate of growth.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/GAF_Nomad	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Gaf	http://dbpedia.org/resource/GAF_Jindivik	http://dbpedia.org/resource/GAF_domain	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Gloria_Material_Technology_Corp.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/1976_Sabah_Air_GAF_Nomad_crash	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Isle_of_Man_Civil_Defence_Corps	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pacific_Bearing_Corp	http://dbpedia.org/resource/French_ship_Six_Corps_(1762)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/X_Corps_(United_Kingdom)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Spy_Corps	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Empress_Casino_Joliet_Corp._v._Giannoulias	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Marine_Corps_Planning_Process	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Math_Science_Teaching_Corps	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Entergy_Corp._v._Riverkeeper_Inc.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/XIX_Corps	http://dbpedia.org/resource/United_States_Navy_Dental_Corps	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Kalmykian_Voluntary_Cavalry_Corps	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Delta_Corp_Limited	http://dbpedia.org/resource/National_Security_Corps

Georgia Power Co	233	249	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Georgia_Power	An audit submitted to the Georgia Public Service Commission claims that between 944 mln dlrs and 1.8 billion dlrs of the costs of the Plant Vogtle nuclear power station should be disallowed, a Southern Co spokeswoman said. Southerns Georgia Power Co subsidiary has a 45.7 pct interest in the plant and estimated earlier this year it would cost a total of 8.87 billion dlrs. Last year, the plants owners pledged to Georgia regulators they would limit the cost passed on to rate payers to 8.4 billion dlrs. The Southern spokeswoman said the company feels the report by OBrien-Kreitzberg is flawed and biased. She said the report was released yesterday by the state attorney general. Responding to the report today, Georgia Power Chairman Robert W. Scherer told a news conference the conclusions drawn by the firm are not only wrong -- they also reflect the same bias against nuclear power that these auditors have demonstrated in similar cases accross the country. Saying he was not suggesting Georgia power was without fault, Scherer said the audit identified several things I wish we had done differently. Scherer pointed out a report OBrien-Kreitzberg submitted to Georgia regulators in March 1986 projected Georgia Power would not finish Plant Vogtle unit one before the end of 1987. Noting unit one is finished, and we expect it to be in commercial operationg by June, he said the firms latest report ignored the earlier projection, gave the utility no credit for the completion and actually penalized us by suggesting that costs to maintain t he schedule be disallowed. Scherer said the latest audit alleges Georgia Power could have saved 95 mln dlrs if it had stopped using four shifts, seven days a week to speed construction three years sooner. He said this would have delayed completion of the plant for another year and it would have cost several hunderd million dlrs more.

International Chamber of Commerce	432	465	http://dbpedia.org/resource/International_Chamber_of_Commerce	The Association of White Metals has decided to publish a daily tin price here in French francs per 100 kilos, the French Federation of Non-Ferrous Metals said. The price, quoted for the first time yesterday, was introduced as the lack of tin quotes was causing problems for some French companies, a spokesman for the non-ferrous metals association said. Todays price was set at 4,776 francs per 100 kilos and Tuesdays at 4,790. The International Chamber of Commerce stopped publishing a tin price after the London Metal Exchange (LME) stopped tin trading on October 24, 1985. The Association has tested the basis it uses to calculate a French franc price over the last few months to ensure it was reliable, the spokesman said. The French franc price is pre-tax, for specified quality, a minimum 99.9 pct purity, at a French port or border railway station and a minimum delivery of 10 tonnes. The French Federation of Non-Ferrous Metals groups various metal associations including the Association of White Metals.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Provinces_of_Iran	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Counties_of_Iran	http://dbpedia.org/resource/National_Register_of_Historic_Places	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Departments_of_France	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Communes_of_France	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Voivodeships_of_Poland	http://dbpedia.org/resource/List_of_sovereign_states	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Political_divisions_of_the_United_States	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Administrative_divisions_of_Azerbaijan	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Republic_of_Ireland	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Provinces_of_Turkey	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Regions_of_France	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bachelor_of_Arts	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Municipalities_of_Slovenia	http://dbpedia.org/resource/States_of_Brazil	http://dbpedia.org/resource/University_of_Michigan	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Statistical_regions_of_Slovenia	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Provinces_of_Spain	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Counties_of_Estonia	http://dbpedia.org/resource/List_of_enzymes

Carter	362	368	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Jimmy_Carter	A Treasury official said there are no plans to try to reduce the U.S. budget deficit by issuing yen-denominated bonds that would become known as Reagan bonds. It simply isnt something that we are planning to do, the official said. He added the Treasury was aware of Japanese news reports suggesting the Reagan administration might issue such bonds as the former Carter administration did when it sold Carter bonds denominated in West German marks. But he said the situation was greatly different now. If you look at the differences between the treasury market now and in the Carter administration years, it is a much more global market now, the official said. There was not the same ease then for the holder of another currency to buy other countries securities, he added, But there is no difficulty now for them to purchase dollars and buy U.S. securities. The United States needs dollars, not Japanese yen, to pay its debts and reduce the deficit and so has no plans to issue yen-denominated bonds, he emphasized.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ron_Carter	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Benny_Carter	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Lin_Carter	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Elliott_Carter	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Carter_Family	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Angela_Carter	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Aaron_Carter	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Carter_Center	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Helena_Bonham_Carter	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Betty_Carter	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Amon_G._Carter_Stadium	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Howard_Carter	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Carter_Glass	http://dbpedia.org/resource/June_Carter_Cash	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Rosalynn_Carter	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Chris_Carter_(screenwriter)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Carter_Burwell	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Lynda_Carter	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Carter_County,_Oklahoma	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Deana_Carter

VW has also said disclosed profits for 1986 will reach their 1985 level, despite provisions of a possible 480 mln marks linked to the currency affair. The figure is virtually the same as the 477 mln mark 1985 parent company net profit.

A dividend of 11 marks would be proposed for the companys new preference shares. Share analysts said they saw supervisory board approval of the management board proposal as virtually a formality.

Federal member of parliament for the region,  Charles-Eugene Marin, said last week the federal government is also prepared to provide financial help to restart operations as soon as possible. Noranda has estimated damage from the fire at about 10 mln dlrs and a company spokesman said it should have a more specific estimate by the end of the month. Noranda said it had hoped to have an estimate sooner, but has found that it will take longer than expected to gain access to the burned-out area. Noranda said the mine was not insured.  said the mine was not insured. "We decided many years ago...that the costs of insuring all of NorandaNoranda's underground operations would have been prohibitive, underground operations would have been prohibitive," Larry Taylor, NorandaNoranda's risk management and insurance director, said. Taylor said before last week said before last week's fire, the company had only had one previous mine accident many years ago. Last weeks fire, the company had only had one previous mine accident many years ago. Last week's fire killed one miner and trapped 52 other underground, some for up to 24 hours. It was believed to have started on a new conveyor system. Noranda has said it would take four to five months to return the mine to normal operating capacity. It produced 72,0000 tons of copper anode last year, Coffin said.

Prudential-Bache Securities	1509	1536	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Prudential_Securities	Promising new findings in the use of a controversial experimental drug called Interleukin-2 as a cure for cancer will be published in the April 9 issue of the prestigious New England Journal of Medicine, according to a Wall Street analyst who has obtained an advance copy of the magazine. Among interleukins principal U. S. makers are Cetus Corp CTUS, headquartered in Emeryville, Calif., and Immunex Corp IMNX, based in Seattle, Wash. The journal, to be released late today, contains two articles reporting high remission rates several cancer types. The journal also contains a signed editorial concluding that the new results mark a significant milestone in the search for a successful immunotherapy for cancer. Interleukin-2, also known as IL-2, is a substance naturally produced by living cells in the laboratory. The drug is controversial because it was widely praised as a promising cancer treatment in early reports on its effectiveness in late 1985, only to come under criticism a year later for its failure to live up to its promise and due to its ravaging side effects. One of the new studies, conducted by Dr. William West of Biotherapeutics Inc of Franklin, Tenn., is particularly significant because it found far fewer harsh side effects after it changed the way in which the drug is administered. In that study, researchers administered IL-2 to 48 cancer patients and found a 50-pct remission rate for kidney cancers and a 50 pct remission rate for melanoma, a type of skin cancer, according to Prudential-Bache Securities Stuart Weisbrod, who obtained the advance copy of the magazine. For rectal and colon cancer, the researchers found no remissions, but none of the 48 patients treated had side effects serious enough to be placed under intensive hospital care, according to the article. In the second study, whose principal author is Dr. Steven Rosenberg of the National Cancer Institute, researchers administered IL-2 to 157 cancer patients and found a 33 pct remission rate in cancers of the kidney, a 27 pct rate in melanomas and a 15 pct rate in cancers of the colon and rectum. In the National Cancer Institute trials, a total of four patients died, the magazine reported, confirming the harshness of the drugs side effects as originally administered. Perhaps we are at the end of the beginning of the search for successful immunotherapy for cancer, said the editorial, signed by John Durant of Philadelphias Chase Cancer Center. These observations reported by Rosenberg and West surely did not describe successful practical approaches ready for widespread applications in the therapy of cancer patients, the editorial said. On the other hand, if they reflect, as seems possible, a successful manipulation of the cellular immune system, then we may be near the end of our search for a meaningful direction in the immunuotherapy of cancer, the editorial concluded.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Security	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Computer_security	http://dbpedia.org/resource/National_Security_Agency	http://dbpedia.org/resource/National_security	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Information_security	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Social_security	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Security_(finance)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/United_Nations_Security_Council	http://dbpedia.org/resource/U.S._Securities_and_Exchange_Commission	http://dbpedia.org/resource/United_Nations_Security_Council_resolution	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Australian_Securities_Exchange	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Food_security	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Transport_Layer_Security	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Security_guard	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Social_Security_(United_States)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/International_Security_Assistance_Force	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Social_Security_Administration	http://dbpedia.org/resource/United_States_Department_of_Homeland_Security	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Network_security	http://dbpedia.org/resource/United_States_National_Security_Council

London commodities and metal exchanges	604	642	http://dbpedia.org/resource/London_Metal_Exchange	Britain intends to negotiate further agreements on international securities regulation to match those now in force with the U.S. And Japan, government sources said. The Department of Trade and Industry said earlier it had concluded a memorandum of understanding with Japans Finance Ministry to swap supervisory and investigatory information. The agreement covers stocks, shares and government bonds, but not commodity futures, whose regulation in Japan does not come under the Finance Ministry. It therefore does not cover some transactions on the London International Financial Futures Exchange and the London commodities and metal exchanges. The DTI said it hoped to seek further understandings with other countries which met in the U.K. Last December. The meeting involved delegates from the U.K., Switzerland, the U.S., Canada, Australia, Hong Kong, Japan, France, West Germany and Holland. Government sources said the deal with Japan completes arrangements linking Tokyo, the U.S. And London. A U.K. Agreement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) was signed last September. Todays agreement will deal with requests for information on a case by case basis, U.K. Government sources said. It is not legally binding and comes into force immediately.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/London	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bosnia_and_Herzegovina	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Track_and_field	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Heavy_metal_music	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Death_metal	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Newfoundland_and_Labrador	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thrash_metal	http://dbpedia.org/resource/University_of_London	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Black_metal	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Trinidad_and_Tobago	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Metal	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Progressive_metal	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Alternative_metal	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Provinces_and_territories_of_Canada	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Municipalities_of_Bosnia_and_Herzegovina	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Castile_and_León	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Rock_and_roll	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Power_metal	http://dbpedia.org/resource/London,_Ontario	http://dbpedia.org/resource/London_Stock_Exchange
United States	862	875	http://dbpedia.org/resource/United_States	A Treasury official said there are no plans to try to reduce the U.S. budget deficit by issuing yen-denominated bonds that would become known as Reagan bonds. It simply isnt something that we are planning to do, the official said. He added the Treasury was aware of Japanese news reports suggesting the Reagan administration might issue such bonds as the former Carter administration did when it sold Carter bonds denominated in West German marks. But he said the situation was greatly different now. If you look at the differences between the treasury market now and in the Carter administration years, it is a much more global market now, the official said. There was not the same ease then for the holder of another currency to buy other countries securities, he added, But there is no difficulty now for them to purchase dollars and buy U.S. securities. The United States needs dollars, not Japanese yen, to pay its debts and reduce the deficit and so has no plans to issue yen-denominated bonds, he emphasized.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/United_Kingdom	http://dbpedia.org/resource/U.S._state	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Political_divisions_of_the_United_States	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Democratic_Party_(United_States)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Republican_Party_(United_States)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/List_of_sovereign_states	http://dbpedia.org/resource/United_States_Census_Bureau	http://dbpedia.org/resource/United_States_Navy	http://dbpedia.org/resource/United_States_Army	http://dbpedia.org/resource/2010_United_States_Census	http://dbpedia.org/resource/United_States_Geological_Survey	http://dbpedia.org/resource/United_Nations	http://dbpedia.org/resource/United_States_Senate	http://dbpedia.org/resource/United_States_dollar	http://dbpedia.org/resource/United_States_House_of_Representatives	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Township_(United_States)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Georgia_(U.S._state)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/United_States_Air_Force	http://dbpedia.org/resource/United_States_Congress	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Washington_(state)

Dealers said that Federal funds were trading at 6-7/16 pct when the Fed announced the operation.

Buenos Aires	1238	1250	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Buenos_Aires	Argentine grain producers adjusted their yield estimates for the 1986/87 coarse grain crop downward in the week to yesterday after the heavy rains at the end of March and beginning of April, trade sources said. They said sunflower, maize and sorghum production estimates had been reduced despite some later warm, dry weather, which has allowed a return to harvesting in some areas. However, as showers fell intermittently after last weekend, producers feared another spell of prolonged and intense rain could cause more damage to crops already badly hit this season. Rains in the middle of last week reached an average of 27 millimetres in parts of Buenos Aires province, 83 mm in Cordoba, 41 in Santa Fe, 50 in Entre Rios and Misiones, 95 in Corrientes, eight in Chaco and 35 in Formosa. There was no rainfall in the same period in La Pampa. Producers feared continued damp conditions could produce rotting and lead to still lower yield estimates for all the crops, including soybean. However, as the lands began drying later in the week harvesting advanced considerably, reaching between 36 and 40 pct of the area sown in the case of sunflower. Deterioration of the sunflower crop evident in harvested material in Cordoba, La Pampa and Buenos Aires forced yield estimates per hectare to be adjusted down again. The seasons sunflowerseed production is now forecast at 2.1 mln to 2.3 mln tonnes, against 2.2 mln to 2.4 mln forecast last week and down 43.9 to 48.8 pct on the 1985/86 record of 4.1 mln. Area sown to sunflowers was two to 2.2 mln hectares, 29.9 to 36.3 pct below the record 3.14 mln hectares last season. Maize harvesting has also reached 36 to 40 pct of the area sown. It is near completion in Cordoba and Santa Fe and will begin in La Pampa and southern Buenos Aires later in April. Production estimates for maize were down from last week at 9.5 mln to 9.8 mln tonnes, against 9.6 mln to 9.9 mln estimated previously. This is 22.2 to 23.4 pct below the 12.4 mln to 12.6 mln tonnes estimated by private sources for the 1985/86 crop and 21.9 to 25.8 pct down on the official figure of 12.8 mln tonnes. Maize was sown on 3.58 mln to 3.78 mln hectares, two to seven pct down on last seasons 3.85 mln. Sorghum was harvested on 23 to 25 pct of the area sown in Cordoba, Santa Fe and Chaco. Harvest will start in La Pampa and Buenos Aires in mid-April. The total area sown was 1.23 mln to 1.30 mln hectares, 10.3 to 15.2 pct down on the 1.45 mln sown last season. The new forecast for the sorghum crop is 2.9 mln to 3.2 mln tonnes compared with three mln to 3.3 mln forecast last week, and is 23.8 to 29.3 pct down on last seasons 4.1 mln to 4.2 mln tonne crop. The soybean crop for this season was not adjusted, remaining at a record 7.5 mln to 7.7 mln tonnes, up 4.2 to 5.5 pct on the 7.2 mln to 7.3 mln estimated by private sources for 1985/86 and 5.6 to 8.5 pct higher than the official figure of 7.1 mln. The area sown to soybeans this season was a record 3.7 mln to 3.8 mln hectares, 10.8 to 13.8 pct up on the record 3.34 mln sown in 1985/86. The soybean crop is showing excessive moisture in some areas and producers fear they may discover more damage. Some experimental harvesting was carried out in Santa Fe on areas making up only about one pct of the total crop but details on this were not available. Preparation of the fields for the 1987/88 wheat crop, which will be sown between May and August or September, has so far not been as intense as in previous years.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Buenos_Aires_Province	http://dbpedia.org/resource/University_of_Buenos_Aires	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Greater_Buenos_Aires	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Buenos_Aires_Underground	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Partidos_of_Buenos_Aires	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Palermo,_Buenos_Aires	http://dbpedia.org/resource/San_Isidro,_Buenos_Aires	http://dbpedia.org/resource/River_Aire	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Morón,_Buenos_Aires	http://dbpedia.org/resource/ATP_Buenos_Aires	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Belgrano,_Buenos_Aires	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Unión_de_Rugby_de_Buenos_Aires	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Estudiantes_de_Buenos_Aires	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Line_E_(Buenos_Aires_Underground)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Recoleta,_Buenos_Aires	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Moreno,_Buenos_Aires	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Junín,_Buenos_Aires	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tigre,_Buenos_Aires	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Buenos_Aires_Cabildo	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Retiro,_Buenos_Aires

VW has also said disclosed profits for 1986 will reach their 1985 level, despite provisions of a possible 480 mln marks linked to the currency affair. The figure is virtually the same as the 477 mln mark 1985 parent company net profit. When VW first confirmed the currency scandal on March 10 it said the management board would propose an unchanged 10-mark dividend to the supervisory board. A dividend of 11 marks would be proposed for the companys new preference shares. Share analysts said they saw supervisory board approval of the management board proposal as virtually a formality. Anything else would be more than a surprise, one said. Company sources said VW would have to dig into reserves to maintain the disclosed profit.

IMF	463	466	http://dbpedia.org/resource/International_Monetary_Fund	The Zambian government has no immediate plans to follow last weeks increase in the producer price of maize with a hike in the retail price of maize meal, an official of the ruling party said. Last December, a 120 pct increase in the consumer price for refined maize meal, a Zambian staple, led to food riots in which at least 15 people died. That price increase, which President Kenneth Kaunda later revoked, followed pressure by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to reduce the governments subsidy bill. However, if the producer price rise, from 6.10 dlrs to 8.67 dlrs per 90-kg bag, is not accompanied by a retail price increase, the government will have to spend more on subsidies, a practice discouraged by the IMF. There is no way out but to raise the subsidy levels of meal. It (the government) would have to choose between the demands of the IMF and those of the people, a Ministry of Agriculture economist said.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/IMF_Stand-By_Arrangement	http://dbpedia.org/resource/IMF_Economic_Review	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ukraine–IMF_relations	http://dbpedia.org/resource/List_of_IMF_ranked_countries_by_GDP	http://dbpedia.org/resource/List_of_IMF_Economic_Counsellors	http://dbpedia.org/resource/IMF_(file_format)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/1976_IMF_Crisis	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Romania-IMF_relations	http://dbpedia.org/resource/IMF_Balance_of_Payments_Manual
Brazil	2185	2191	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Brazil	J.P. Morgan and Co Inc said its first-quarter earnings fell by 3.2 pct, largely reflecting its previously announced decision to place on non-accrual status its 1.3 billion dlrs of medium- and long-term loans to Brazil. That decision, spurred by Brazils suspension of interest payments on February 20, reduced the quarters net income by 20 mln dlrs to 226.4 mln dlrs, compared with 233.9 mln in the first three months of 1986. Morgan also reported a loss of 1.8 mln dlrs from securities underwriting and trading, in contrast to a gain of 45.4 mln dlrs in the year-earlier period. In the fourth quarter of 1986, Morgan posted other trading losses of 5.5 mln dlrs because of setbacks in the trading and underwriting of Euromarket securities. Conditions in some sectors of the Euromarket remained difficult last quarter, with floating rate notes suffering heavy price falls, but a spokeswoman was unable to say whether Morgans trading losses were restricted to the Euromarket. On the positive side, Morgan reduced its provision for loan losses to 35 mln dlrs from 70 mln a year earlier. Foreign exchange trading income rose to 82 mln dlrs from 72.6 mln and trust income increased to 95.9 mln dlrs from 75.9 mln. Morgan said other operating income, mainly fees and commissions, rose to 102.2 mln dlrs from 88.4 mln, but net investment securities gains dropped to 43.1 mln from 58.1 mln. Net interest earnings were 490.4 mln dlrs in the first quarter, down from 499.4 mln a year earlier, and net yield fell to 2.79 pct from 3.20 pct. If Brazil had not been placed on non-accrual, which means that interest can be recorded as income only when payments are actually received, net interest earnings would have been 525.9 mln dlrs and net yield 2.99 pct. If Brazil does not resume payments, 1987 net would be cut by 72 mln dlrs, Morgan added. After the provision for loan losses, Morgans allowance for credit losses at the end of March totaled 953 mln dlrs compared with 910 mln at end-1986 and 815 mln a year earlier. It reported net recoveries of six mln dlrs after charge-offs of eight mln, compared with net charge-offs of 49 mln dlrs after recoveries of three mln a year earlier. Excluding Brazil, non-accruing loans at quarters end were 583 mln dlrs, down from 633 mln at end-1986 and 684 mln a year earlier. Non-interest expenses rose to 371.1 mln dlrs from 303.5 mln dlrs, with more than half the increase related to personnel costs, Morgan said.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/States_of_Brazil	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Municipalities_of_Brazil	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Regions_of_Brazil	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Northeast_Region,_Brazil	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Brazil_national_football_team	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Southeast_Region,_Brazil	http://dbpedia.org/resource/South_Region,_Brazil	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ministry_of_Transport_(Brazil)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Time_in_Brazil	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Federal_District_(Brazil)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Colonial_Brazil	http://dbpedia.org/resource/President_of_Brazil	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Workers'_Party_(Brazil)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mesoregions_of_Brazil	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Empire_of_Brazil	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Microregions_of_Brazil	http://dbpedia.org/resource/North_Region,_Brazil	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Central-West_Region,_Brazil	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Football_in_Brazil	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pedro_II_of_Brazil

SEC	948	951	http://dbpedia.org/resource/U.S._Securities_and_Exchange_Commission	Securities and Exchange Commission John Shad said he wanted Congress to write a better definition of insider trading but thought action should wait until the Supreme Court ruled on an insider trading case. Id like the benefit of the Winans decision before deciding on a definition, Shad told a Senate Appropriations subcommittee hearing. Shad was refering to the appeal by former Wall Street Journal reporter R. Foster Winans of his conviction on insider trading charges for telling a friend in advance what stocks he was going to write about in his column. The stocks usually went up or down in price depending on Winans recommendation. He said insider trading accounted for only 11 percent of the SECs enforcement activities last year despite the publicity given to recent major cases. Insider trading makes up only a tiny fraction of one pct of the 50 billion dlrs of daily securities trading, Shad said. Shad asked for a budget increase so the SEC could enlarge its enforcement staff by 20 this year and 73 next year to deal with all types of securities fraud. Shad said he hoped to start his new duties as U.S. Ambassador to the Netherlands by June. He said he did not know when his successor would be named by President Reagan.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Norroy-le-Sec	http://dbpedia.org/resource/1965–66_SEC_Bastia_season	http://dbpedia.org/resource/2017_SEC_Men's_Basketball_Tournament	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Villey-le-Sec	http://dbpedia.org/resource/2012_SEC_Softball_Tournament	http://dbpedia.org/resource/2011_SEC_Championship_Game	http://dbpedia.org/resource/1943_All-SEC_football_team	http://dbpedia.org/resource/2001_SEC_Championship_Game	http://dbpedia.org/resource/1966_All-SEC_football_team	http://dbpedia.org/resource/2009_SEC_Women's_Basketball_Tournament	http://dbpedia.org/resource/1941_All-SEC_football_team	http://dbpedia.org/resource/2013_All-SEC_football_team	http://dbpedia.org/resource/SEC_TV	http://dbpedia.org/resource/1950_All-SEC_football_team	http://dbpedia.org/resource/2008_SEC_Women's_Basketball_Tournament	http://dbpedia.org/resource/El_Poble-sec,_Barcelona	http://dbpedia.org/resource/2016_SEC_Softball_Tournament	http://dbpedia.org/resource/1983_SEC_Women's_Basketball_Tournament	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Rue_de_l'Arbre-Sec	http://dbpedia.org/resource/7-day_SEC_yield
J.P. Stevens	3116	3128	http://dbpedia.org/resource/WestPoint_Home	The largest U.S. textile maker focused on its own business as its competitors found merger partners, but now Burlington Industries Inc may have restructured itself into an attractive takeover candidate, analysts said. The takeover spotlight fell today on Burlington, which rose 4-7/8 to 52-7/8 on speculation that investor Asher Edelman and Dominion Textiles Inc of Canada bought an almost five pct stake. A published report said Edelman and Dominion jointly acquired a stake in Burlington and were weighing a takeover offer. Edelman would not comment, and a spokesman for Montreal-based Dominion called the report just rumors. Burlington said it did not know if the report was true. Wall Street professionals said they were not convinced of the story or that Edelman and Dominion would be the victors if Burlington actually came into play. Arbitragers said past comments from Dominion, however, added credence to the speculation. Dominion has said that it was looking for a takeover in the U.S. Last year, Dominion unsuccessfully bid for Avondale Mills and has maintained a 120 mln dlr line of credit to be used for a U.S. acquisition. A Dominion spokesman said Canadas largest textile producer has been negotiating with many U.S. textile companies, but would not say whether Burlington was among them. There have been acquisitions in this area. Its not unusual that someone could be looking at Burlington after the housecleaning theyve done, said Eileen Gormley of Thomson McKinnon. Burlington sold its domestic operations, which made sheets and other linens, to J.P. Stevens and Co Inc for 110 mln dlrs last year. It also has reorganized management, and focused its operations on businesses that would be less affected by foreign competition, Gormley said. Theyve pulled back so as not to be a commodity marketer, said Gormley. She said in moving more heavily into industrial fabrics, Burlington bought C.H. Masland, which supplies carpets and other fabric to the auto industry. In the past, they just spent and never realized the return on the outlays they did make, she said. You look at their record over the year, and I think theyre poised to be more profitable than they had been in the past, Gormley said. She estimated 1987 earnings of 2.50 dlrs per share, up from 2.01 dlrs per share. Some analysts today recommended clients not buy Burlington at its current levels. Edward Johnson of Johnson Redbook said he recommends selling. He said he believes the stock is worth only about 50 dlrs on a takeover basis and about 46 dlrs on an earnings basis. Some arbitragers, however, said takeover values have been placed on the company of 60 to 65 dlrs per share. After Ashers (Edelman) recent history, a lot of people dont find him very credible anymore, said one arbitrager. Another, however, said Edelman succeeds in forcing managements to take steps to enhance shareholder values even if he doesnt win the target company. Edelman was unsuccessful last year in offers for Lucky Stores Inc and Fruehauf Corp. He did succeed in buying Ponderosa Inc. The stocks of other textile makers rose along with Burlington. J.P. Stevens STN climbed 5/8 to 44-7/8, and Fieldcrest Cannon Inc FLD, the result of a merger of Fieldcrest and Cannon, rose 1-1/8 to 39-3/4.

GAF	385	388	http://dbpedia.org/resource/GAF_Materials_Corporation	Cheap oil feedstocks, the weakened U.S. dollar and a plant utilization rate approaching 90 pct will propel the streamlined U.S. petrochemical industry to record profits this year, with growth expected through at least 1990, major company executives predicted. This bullish outlook for chemical manufacturing and an industrywide move to shed unrelated businesses has prompted GAF Corp (GAF), privately-held Cain Chemical Inc, and other firms to aggressively seek acquisitions of petrochemical plants. Oil companies such as Ashland Oil Inc (ASH), the Kentucky-based oil refiner and marketer, are also shopping for money-making petrochemical businesses to buy. I see us poised at the threshold of a golden period, said Paul Oreffice, chairman of giant Dow Chemical Co (DOW), adding, Theres no major plant capacity being added around the world now. The whole game is bringing out new products and improving the old ones. Analysts say the chemical industrys biggest customers, automobile manufacturers and home builders that use a lot of paints and plastics, are expected to buy quantities this year. U.S. petrochemical plants are currently operating at about 90 pct capacity, reflecting tighter supply that could hike product prices by 30 to 40 pct this year, said John Dosher, managing director of Pace Consultants Inc of Houston. Demand for some products such as styrene could push profit margins up by as much as 300 pct, he said. Oreffice, speaking at a meeting of chemical engineers in Houston, said Dow would easily top the 741 mln dlrs it earned last year and predicted it would have the best year in its history. In 1985, when oil prices were still above 25 dlrs a barrel and chemical exports were adversely affected by the strong U.S. dollar, Dow had profits of 58 mln dlrs. I believe the entire chemical industry is headed for a record year or close to it, Oreffice said. GAF chairman Samuel Heyman estimated that the U.S. chemical industry would report a 20 pct gain in profits during 1987. Last year, the domestic industry earned a total of 13 billion dlrs, a 54 pct leap from 1985. The turn in the fortunes of the once-sickly chemical industry has been brought about by a combination of luck and planning, said Paces John Dosher. Dosher said last years fall in oil prices made feedstocks dramatically cheaper and at the same time the American dollar was weakening against foreign currencies. That helped boost U.S. chemical exports. Also helping to bring supply and demand into balance has been the gradual market absorption of the extra chemical manufacturing capacity created by Middle Eastern oil producers in the early 1980s. Finally, virtually all major U.S. chemical manufacturers have embarked on an extensive corporate restructuring program to mothball inefficient plants, trim the payroll and eliminate unrelated businesses. The restructuring touched off a flurry of friendly and hostile takeover attempts. GAF, which made an unsuccessful attempt in 1985 to acquire Union Carbide Corp UK, recently offered three billion dlrs for Borg Warner Corp BOR, a Chicago manufacturer of plastics and chemicals. Another industry powerhouse, W.R. Grace (GRA) has divested its retailing, restaurant and fertilizer businesses to raise cash for chemical acquisitions. But some experts worry that the chemical industry may be headed for trouble if companies continue turning their back on the manufacturing of staple petrochemical commodities, such as ethylene, in favor of more profitable specialty chemicals that are custom-designed for a small group of buyers. Companies like DuPont (DD) and Monsanto Co MTC spent the past two or three years trying to get out of the commodity chemical business in reaction to how badly the market had deteriorated, Dosher said. But I think they will eventually kill the margins on the profitable chemicals in the niche market. Some top chemical executives share the concern. The challenge for our industry is to keep from getting carried away and repeating past mistakes, GAFs Heyman cautioned. The shift from commodity chemicals may be ill-advised. Specialty businesses do not stay special long. Houston-based Cain Chemical, created this month by the Sterling investment banking group, believes it can generate 700 mln dlrs in annual sales by bucking the industry trend. Chairman Gordon Cain, who previously led a leveraged buyout of Duponts Conoco Incs chemical business, has spent 1.1 billion dlrs since January to buy seven petrochemical plants along the Texas Gulf Coast. The plants produce only basic commodity petrochemicals that are the building blocks of specialty products. This kind of commodity chemical business will never be a glamorous, high-margin business, Cain said, adding that demand is expected to grow by about three pct annually. Garo Armen, an analyst with Dean Witter Reynolds, said chemical makers have also benefitted by increasing demand for plastics as prices become more competitive with aluminum, wood and steel products. Armen estimated the upturn in the chemical business could last as long as four or five years, provided the U.S. economy continues its modest rate of growth.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/GAF_Nomad	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Gaf	http://dbpedia.org/resource/GAF_Jindivik	http://dbpedia.org/resource/GAF_domain	http://dbpedia.org/resource/1976_Sabah_Air_GAF_Nomad_crash
Edouard Saouma	285	299	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Edouard_Saouma	World output of staple foods maintained growth in 1986, following a record harvest the year before, and most of the increase was in developing countries, the director general of the U.N.s Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) said. Speaking to FAOs committee on world food security, Edouard Saouma said sub-Saharan Africa registered a cereal production increase of 3.6 pct in 1986 and the Far East also continued to increase production. Despite ample supplies worldwide, many countries face problems in paying for all the food they need, he said. Saouma said many of the developing worlds food problems were the result of chaotic world trade. He said it was vital to promote employment to improve the food-security situation of the poor, with policy reforms in developing countries to remove existing disincentives to production so that agriculture could play a greater role in stimulating economic growth.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Frans_Hubert_Edouard_Arthur_Walter_Robyns	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Edouard_Espinosa	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Edouard_Borovansky	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Edouard_Malingue_Gallery	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Norman_Edouard_Hartweg	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Edouard_Izac	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Edouard_Roditi	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Edouard_Aleata	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Edouard_Van_Beneden	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Edouard_Pliner	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Edouard-Marcel_Sandoz	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Edouard_Kutter_(1887)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Edouard_Agneessens	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Edouard_d'Huart	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Edouard_Sarasin	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Edouard_Joseph	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Edouard_Mielche	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Jules_Edouard_Roiné	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Edouard_Pycke	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Edouard_Kutter_(1934)
Wall Street Journal	380	399	http://dbpedia.org/resource/The_Wall_Street_Journal	Securities and Exchange Commission John Shad said he wanted Congress to write a better definition of insider trading but thought action should wait until the Supreme Court ruled on an insider trading case. Id like the benefit of the Winans decision before deciding on a definition, Shad told a Senate Appropriations subcommittee hearing. Shad was refering to the appeal by former Wall Street Journal reporter R. Foster Winans of his conviction on insider trading charges for telling a friend in advance what stocks he was going to write about in his column. The stocks usually went up or down in price depending on Winans recommendation. He said insider trading accounted for only 11 percent of the SECs enforcement activities last year despite the publicity given to recent major cases. Insider trading makes up only a tiny fraction of one pct of the 50 billion dlrs of daily securities trading, Shad said. Shad asked for a budget increase so the SEC could enlarge its enforcement staff by 20 this year and 73 next year to deal with all types of securities fraud. Shad said he hoped to start his new duties as U.S. Ambassador to the Netherlands by June. He said he did not know when his successor would be named by President Reagan.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Academic_journal	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Scientific_journal	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Journal_Citation_Reports	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Wall_Street	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Nature_(journal)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Coronation_Street	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sesame_Street	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Science_(journal)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Berlin_Wall	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Street	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Library_Journal	http://dbpedia.org/resource/School_Library_Journal	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Journal	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hadrian's_Wall	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Fleet_Street	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Street_art	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Defensive_wall	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Wall	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Occupy_Wall_Street	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cell_wall

Japans Finance Ministry	267	290	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ministry_of_Finance_(Japan)	Britain intends to negotiate further agreements on international securities regulation to match those now in force with the U.S. And Japan, government sources said. The Department of Trade and Industry said earlier it had concluded a memorandum of understanding with Japans Finance Ministry to swap supervisory and investigatory information. The agreement covers stocks, shares and government bonds, but not commodity futures, whose regulation in Japan does not come under the Finance Ministry. It therefore does not cover some transactions on the London International Financial Futures Exchange and the London commodities and metal exchanges. The DTI said it hoped to seek further understandings with other countries which met in the U.K. Last December. The meeting involved delegates from the U.K., Switzerland, the U.S., Canada, Australia, Hong Kong, Japan, France, West Germany and Holland. Government sources said the deal with Japan completes arrangements linking Tokyo, the U.S. And London. A U.K. Agreement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) was signed last September. Todays agreement will deal with requests for information on a case by case basis, U.K. Government sources said. It is not legally binding and comes into force immediately.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Japan	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Finance	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ministry_of_Railways_(Pakistan)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Empire_of_Japan	http://dbpedia.org/resource/List_of_towns_in_Japan	http://dbpedia.org/resource/National_highways_of_Japan	http://dbpedia.org/resource/List_of_railway_stations_in_Japan	http://dbpedia.org/resource/East_Japan_Railway_Company	http://dbpedia.org/resource/West_Japan_Railway_Company	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ministry_of_Defence_(United_Kingdom)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Districts_of_Japan	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Municipalities_of_Japan	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cinema_of_Japan	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sea_of_Japan	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Japan_Football_League	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Prefectures_of_Japan	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ministry_of_Transport_(Brazil)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bond_(finance)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cities_of_Japan	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Surrender_of_Japan
Ghana	1540	1545	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ghana	Major cocoa exporters are likely to limit sales in the weeks ahead in an effort to boost world prices, sources close to a meeting of the Cocoa Producers Alliance (CPA) said. The sources said the depressed world market had been one of the main topics discussed in a closed door meeting of the 11-member CPA which began on Monday. They said producers agreed that cutting sales would aid the buffer stock manager of a new international cocoa pact in his effort to support prices. Major cocoa producing and consuming nations agreed operation rules for the buffer stock at a meeting in London last month and the stock manager is expected to enter the market soon. Prices, under the weight of three successive cocoa surpluses, recently fell to the level at which the manager has to buy cocoa under stock rules. The buffer stock aims to keep prices within a pre-set range by buying when prices fall and selling when they rise. The worlds cocoa price at present is just not interesting, commented one delegate representing a major CPA producer. Another source said that with much of the 1986/87 (October-September) world cocoa crop sold, limiting sales in the near term concerns essentially next years harvest. The sources noted, however, that the cocoa industry in Brazil, the worlds number two producer, is in private hands. This means limiting sales is more difficult than in major West African producers, where sales are made or authorized by commodity marketing boards. The CPA includes the worlds top three producers, Ivory Coast, Brazil and Ghana, and accounts for 80 pct of all output. The meeting here is due to end tomorrow evening.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Regions_of_Ghana	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ghana_national_football_team	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Districts_of_Ghana	http://dbpedia.org/resource/University_of_Ghana	http://dbpedia.org/resource/National_Democratic_Congress_(Ghana)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Western_Region_(Ghana)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Parliament_of_Ghana	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Eastern_Region_(Ghana)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/List_of_Ghana_Parliament_constituencies	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tamale,_Ghana	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Government_of_Ghana	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ghana_Football_Leagues	http://dbpedia.org/resource/President_of_Ghana	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Central_Region_(Ghana)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ho,_Ghana	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Northern_Region_(Ghana)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Education_in_Ghana	http://dbpedia.org/resource/People's_National_Convention_(Ghana)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ghana_Empire	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bank_of_Ghana

Morgan	610	616	http://dbpedia.org/resource/J._P._Morgan	J.P. Morgan and Co Inc said its first-quarter earnings fell by 3.2 pct, largely reflecting its previously announced decision to place on non-accrual status its 1.3 billion dlrs of medium- and long-term loans to Brazil. That decision, spurred by Brazils suspension of interest payments on February 20, reduced the quarters net income by 20 mln dlrs to 226.4 mln dlrs, compared with 233.9 mln in the first three months of 1986. Morgan also reported a loss of 1.8 mln dlrs from securities underwriting and trading, in contrast to a gain of 45.4 mln dlrs in the year-earlier period. In the fourth quarter of 1986, Morgan posted other trading losses of 5.5 mln dlrs because of setbacks in the trading and underwriting of Euromarket securities. Conditions in some sectors of the Euromarket remained difficult last quarter, with floating rate notes suffering heavy price falls, but a spokeswoman was unable to say whether Morgans trading losses were restricted to the Euromarket. On the positive side, Morgan reduced its provision for loan losses to 35 mln dlrs from 70 mln a year earlier. Foreign exchange trading income rose to 82 mln dlrs from 72.6 mln and trust income increased to 95.9 mln dlrs from 75.9 mln. Morgan said other operating income, mainly fees and commissions, rose to 102.2 mln dlrs from 88.4 mln, but net investment securities gains dropped to 43.1 mln from 58.1 mln. Net interest earnings were 490.4 mln dlrs in the first quarter, down from 499.4 mln a year earlier, and net yield fell to 2.79 pct from 3.20 pct. If Brazil had not been placed on non-accrual, which means that interest can be recorded as income only when payments are actually received, net interest earnings would have been 525.9 mln dlrs and net yield 2.99 pct. If Brazil does not resume payments, 1987 net would be cut by 72 mln dlrs, Morgan added. After the provision for loan losses, Morgans allowance for credit losses at the end of March totaled 953 mln dlrs compared with 910 mln at end-1986 and 815 mln a year earlier. It reported net recoveries of six mln dlrs after charge-offs of eight mln, compared with net charge-offs of 49 mln dlrs after recoveries of three mln a year earlier. Excluding Brazil, non-accruing loans at quarters end were 583 mln dlrs, down from 633 mln at end-1986 and 684 mln a year earlier. Non-interest expenses rose to 371.1 mln dlrs from 303.5 mln dlrs, with more than half the increase related to personnel costs, Morgan said.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Morgan_Stanley	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Morgan_Freeman	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Morgan_Tsvangirai	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Morgan_State_University	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Lee_Morgan	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Morgan_County,_Indiana	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Piers_Morgan	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Harry_Morgan	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Morgan_City,_Louisiana	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Michèle_Morgan	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tracy_Morgan	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Morgan_County,_Ohio	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Robin_Morgan	http://dbpedia.org/resource/John_Hunt_Morgan	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Lorrie_Morgan	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Morgan_Spurlock	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Frank_Morgan	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Henry_Morgan	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Morgan_Studios	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Reuben_Morgan

Monsanto Co	3597	3608	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Monsanto	Cheap oil feedstocks, the weakened U.S. dollar and a plant utilization rate approaching 90 pct will propel the streamlined U.S. petrochemical industry to record profits this year, with growth expected through at least 1990, major company executives predicted. This bullish outlook for chemical manufacturing and an industrywide move to shed unrelated businesses has prompted GAF Corp (GAF), privately-held Cain Chemical Inc, and other firms to aggressively seek acquisitions of petrochemical plants. Oil companies such as Ashland Oil Inc (ASH), the Kentucky-based oil refiner and marketer, are also shopping for money-making petrochemical businesses to buy. I see us poised at the threshold of a golden period, said Paul Oreffice, chairman of giant Dow Chemical Co (DOW), adding, Theres no major plant capacity being added around the world now. The whole game is bringing out new products and improving the old ones. Analysts say the chemical industrys biggest customers, automobile manufacturers and home builders that use a lot of paints and plastics, are expected to buy quantities this year. U.S. petrochemical plants are currently operating at about 90 pct capacity, reflecting tighter supply that could hike product prices by 30 to 40 pct this year, said John Dosher, managing director of Pace Consultants Inc of Houston. Demand for some products such as styrene could push profit margins up by as much as 300 pct, he said. Oreffice, speaking at a meeting of chemical engineers in Houston, said Dow would easily top the 741 mln dlrs it earned last year and predicted it would have the best year in its history. In 1985, when oil prices were still above 25 dlrs a barrel and chemical exports were adversely affected by the strong U.S. dollar, Dow had profits of 58 mln dlrs. I believe the entire chemical industry is headed for a record year or close to it, Oreffice said. GAF chairman Samuel Heyman estimated that the U.S. chemical industry would report a 20 pct gain in profits during 1987. Last year, the domestic industry earned a total of 13 billion dlrs, a 54 pct leap from 1985. The turn in the fortunes of the once-sickly chemical industry has been brought about by a combination of luck and planning, said Paces John Dosher. Dosher said last years fall in oil prices made feedstocks dramatically cheaper and at the same time the American dollar was weakening against foreign currencies. That helped boost U.S. chemical exports. Also helping to bring supply and demand into balance has been the gradual market absorption of the extra chemical manufacturing capacity created by Middle Eastern oil producers in the early 1980s. Finally, virtually all major U.S. chemical manufacturers have embarked on an extensive corporate restructuring program to mothball inefficient plants, trim the payroll and eliminate unrelated businesses. The restructuring touched off a flurry of friendly and hostile takeover attempts. GAF, which made an unsuccessful attempt in 1985 to acquire Union Carbide Corp UK, recently offered three billion dlrs for Borg Warner Corp BOR, a Chicago manufacturer of plastics and chemicals. Another industry powerhouse, W.R. Grace (GRA) has divested its retailing, restaurant and fertilizer businesses to raise cash for chemical acquisitions. But some experts worry that the chemical industry may be headed for trouble if companies continue turning their back on the manufacturing of staple petrochemical commodities, such as ethylene, in favor of more profitable specialty chemicals that are custom-designed for a small group of buyers. Companies like DuPont (DD) and Monsanto Co MTC spent the past two or three years trying to get out of the commodity chemical business in reaction to how badly the market had deteriorated, Dosher said. But I think they will eventually kill the margins on the profitable chemicals in the niche market. Some top chemical executives share the concern. The challenge for our industry is to keep from getting carried away and repeating past mistakes, GAFs Heyman cautioned. The shift from commodity chemicals may be ill-advised. Specialty businesses do not stay special long. Houston-based Cain Chemical, created this month by the Sterling investment banking group, believes it can generate 700 mln dlrs in annual sales by bucking the industry trend. Chairman Gordon Cain, who previously led a leveraged buyout of Duponts Conoco Incs chemical business, has spent 1.1 billion dlrs since January to buy seven petrochemical plants along the Texas Gulf Coast. The plants produce only basic commodity petrochemicals that are the building blocks of specialty products. This kind of commodity chemical business will never be a glamorous, high-margin business, Cain said, adding that demand is expected to grow by about three pct annually.

Japan Air Lines Co Ltd	76	98	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Japan_Airlines	Faulty repair work by The Boeing Company BA.N was a contributary cause to a Japan Air Lines Co Ltd JAPN.Y 747 crash on August 12, 1985, that killed 520 people, the final draft of a Ministry of Transport report says. There were only four survivors when the aircraft crashed into a mountain north of Tokyo. The report said inadequate inspection of the aircraft by Japanese inspectors after the repairs was another factor in the crash. The crew were cleared of any responsibility for the disaster. The report, which was sent on March 23 to the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board for comment, should be released in late May. Under an international convention the draft must be submitted for final comments to the relevant authorities. Boeing spokesmen were unavailable for comment. On April 4, a Boeing spokesman at the firms headquarters said the company would probably make no comment on the Japanese investigation teams report until it was officially released. On September 6, 1985, Boeing said in a statement that the 1978 repairs it had undertaken were faulty. This statement did not, however, connect the faulty repairs with the cause of the crash.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Japan	http://dbpedia.org/resource/East_Japan_Railway_Company	http://dbpedia.org/resource/West_Japan_Railway_Company	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Empire_of_Japan	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Japan_Football_League	http://dbpedia.org/resource/List_of_towns_in_Japan	http://dbpedia.org/resource/National_highways_of_Japan	http://dbpedia.org/resource/List_of_railway_stations_in_Japan	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Districts_of_Japan	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Liberal_Democratic_Party_(Japan)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Municipalities_of_Japan	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cinema_of_Japan	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Japan_national_football_team	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Japan_Hot_100	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sea_of_Japan	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Prefectures_of_Japan	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Central_Japan_Railway_Company	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Japan_Standard_Time	http://dbpedia.org/resource/King_Records_(Japan)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cities_of_Japan
Burlington	1396	1406	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Burlington_Industries	The largest U.S. textile maker focused on its own business as its competitors found merger partners, but now Burlington Industries Inc may have restructured itself into an attractive takeover candidate, analysts said. The takeover spotlight fell today on Burlington, which rose 4-7/8 to 52-7/8 on speculation that investor Asher Edelman and Dominion Textiles Inc of Canada bought an almost five pct stake. A published report said Edelman and Dominion jointly acquired a stake in Burlington and were weighing a takeover offer. Edelman would not comment, and a spokesman for Montreal-based Dominion called the report just rumors. Burlington said it did not know if the report was true. Wall Street professionals said they were not convinced of the story or that Edelman and Dominion would be the victors if Burlington actually came into play. Arbitragers said past comments from Dominion, however, added credence to the speculation. Dominion has said that it was looking for a takeover in the U.S. Last year, Dominion unsuccessfully bid for Avondale Mills and has maintained a 120 mln dlr line of credit to be used for a U.S. acquisition. A Dominion spokesman said Canadas largest textile producer has been negotiating with many U.S. textile companies, but would not say whether Burlington was among them. There have been acquisitions in this area. Its not unusual that someone could be looking at Burlington after the housecleaning theyve done, said Eileen Gormley of Thomson McKinnon. Burlington sold its domestic operations, which made sheets and other linens, to J.P. Stevens and Co Inc for 110 mln dlrs last year. It also has reorganized management, and focused its operations on businesses that would be less affected by foreign competition, Gormley said. Theyve pulled back so as not to be a commodity marketer, said Gormley. She said in moving more heavily into industrial fabrics, Burlington bought C.H. Masland, which supplies carpets and other fabric to the auto industry. In the past, they just spent and never realized the return on the outlays they did make, she said. You look at their record over the year, and I think theyre poised to be more profitable than they had been in the past, Gormley said. She estimated 1987 earnings of 2.50 dlrs per share, up from 2.01 dlrs per share. Some analysts today recommended clients not buy Burlington at its current levels. Edward Johnson of Johnson Redbook said he recommends selling. He said he believes the stock is worth only about 50 dlrs on a takeover basis and about 46 dlrs on an earnings basis. Some arbitragers, however, said takeover values have been placed on the company of 60 to 65 dlrs per share. After Ashers (Edelman) recent history, a lot of people dont find him very credible anymore, said one arbitrager. Another, however, said Edelman succeeds in forcing managements to take steps to enhance shareholder values even if he doesnt win the target company. Edelman was unsuccessful last year in offers for Lucky Stores Inc and Fruehauf Corp. He did succeed in buying Ponderosa Inc. The stocks of other textile makers rose along with Burlington. J.P. Stevens STN climbed 5/8 to 44-7/8, and Fieldcrest Cannon Inc FLD, the result of a merger of Fieldcrest and Cannon, rose 1-1/8 to 39-3/4. West Point-Pepperell Inc WPM rose 1-7/8 to 67-1/8.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Burlington,_Vermont	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Burlington,_Ontario	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Burlington,_Iowa	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Burlington_County,_New_Jersey	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Burlington,_North_Carolina	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Chicago,_Burlington_and_Quincy_Railroad	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Burlington_Northern_Railroad	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Burlington,_New_Jersey	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Burlington,_Massachusetts	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Burlington,_Wisconsin	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Burlington_Coat_Factory	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Burlington_House	http://dbpedia.org/resource/The_Burlington_Magazine	http://dbpedia.org/resource/South_Burlington,_Vermont	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Burlington,_Colorado	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Burlington_Bees	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Burlington_Arcade	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Burlington,_Connecticut	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Burlington,_Kentucky	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Burlington,_Washington

U.K. Government	1179	1194	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Government_of_the_United_Kingdom	Britain intends to negotiate further agreements on international securities regulation to match those now in force with the U.S. And Japan, government sources said. The Department of Trade and Industry said earlier it had concluded a memorandum of understanding with Japans Finance Ministry to swap supervisory and investigatory information. The agreement covers stocks, shares and government bonds, but not commodity futures, whose regulation in Japan does not come under the Finance Ministry. It therefore does not cover some transactions on the London International Financial Futures Exchange and the London commodities and metal exchanges. The DTI said it hoped to seek further understandings with other countries which met in the U.K. Last December. The meeting involved delegates from the U.K., Switzerland, the U.S., Canada, Australia, Hong Kong, Japan, France, West Germany and Holland. Government sources said the deal with Japan completes arrangements linking Tokyo, the U.S. And London. A U.K. Agreement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) was signed last September. Todays agreement will deal with requests for information on a case by case basis, U.K. Government sources said.

Houston	4136	4143	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Houston	Cheap oil feedstocks, the weakened U.S. dollar and a plant utilization rate approaching 90 pct will propel the streamlined U.S. petrochemical industry to record profits this year, with growth expected through at least 1990, major company executives predicted. This bullish outlook for chemical manufacturing and an industrywide move to shed unrelated businesses has prompted GAF Corp (GAF), privately-held Cain Chemical Inc, and other firms to aggressively seek acquisitions of petrochemical plants. Oil companies such as Ashland Oil Inc (ASH), the Kentucky-based oil refiner and marketer, are also shopping for money-making petrochemical businesses to buy. I see us poised at the threshold of a golden period, said Paul Oreffice, chairman of giant Dow Chemical Co (DOW), adding, Theres no major plant capacity being added around the world now. The whole game is bringing out new products and improving the old ones. Analysts say the chemical industrys biggest customers, automobile manufacturers and home builders that use a lot of paints and plastics, are expected to buy quantities this year. U.S. petrochemical plants are currently operating at about 90 pct capacity, reflecting tighter supply that could hike product prices by 30 to 40 pct this year, said John Dosher, managing director of Pace Consultants Inc of Houston. Demand for some products such as styrene could push profit margins up by as much as 300 pct, he said. Oreffice, speaking at a meeting of chemical engineers in Houston, said Dow would easily top the 741 mln dlrs it earned last year and predicted it would have the best year in its history. In 1985, when oil prices were still above 25 dlrs a barrel and chemical exports were adversely affected by the strong U.S. dollar, Dow had profits of 58 mln dlrs. I believe the entire chemical industry is headed for a record year or close to it, Oreffice said. GAF chairman Samuel Heyman estimated that the U.S. chemical industry would report a 20 pct gain in profits during 1987. Last year, the domestic industry earned a total of 13 billion dlrs, a 54 pct leap from 1985. The turn in the fortunes of the once-sickly chemical industry has been brought about by a combination of luck and planning, said Paces John Dosher. Dosher said last years fall in oil prices made feedstocks dramatically cheaper and at the same time the American dollar was weakening against foreign currencies. That helped boost U.S. chemical exports. Also helping to bring supply and demand into balance has been the gradual market absorption of the extra chemical manufacturing capacity created by Middle Eastern oil producers in the early 1980s. Finally, virtually all major U.S. chemical manufacturers have embarked on an extensive corporate restructuring program to mothball inefficient plants, trim the payroll and eliminate unrelated businesses. The restructuring touched off a flurry of friendly and hostile takeover attempts. GAF, which made an unsuccessful attempt in 1985 to acquire Union Carbide Corp UK, recently offered three billion dlrs for Borg Warner Corp BOR, a Chicago manufacturer of plastics and chemicals. Another industry powerhouse, W.R. Grace (GRA) has divested its retailing, restaurant and fertilizer businesses to raise cash for chemical acquisitions. But some experts worry that the chemical industry may be headed for trouble if companies continue turning their back on the manufacturing of staple petrochemical commodities, such as ethylene, in favor of more profitable specialty chemicals that are custom-designed for a small group of buyers. Companies like DuPont (DD) and Monsanto Co MTC spent the past two or three years trying to get out of the commodity chemical business in reaction to how badly the market had deteriorated, Dosher said. But I think they will eventually kill the margins on the profitable chemicals in the niche market. Some top chemical executives share the concern. The challenge for our industry is to keep from getting carried away and repeating past mistakes, GAFs Heyman cautioned. The shift from commodity chemicals may be ill-advised. Specialty businesses do not stay special long. Houston-based Cain Chemical, created this month by the Sterling investment banking group, believes it can generate 700 mln dlrs in annual sales by bucking the industry trend. Chairman Gordon Cain, who previously led a leveraged buyout of Duponts Conoco Incs chemical business, has spent 1.1 billion dlrs since January to buy seven petrochemical plants along the Texas Gulf Coast. The plants produce only basic commodity petrochemicals that are the building blocks of specialty products. This kind of commodity chemical business will never be a glamorous, high-margin business, Cain said, adding that demand is expected to grow by about three pct annually. Garo Armen, an analyst with Dean Witter Reynolds, said chemical makers have also benefitted by increasing demand for plastics as prices become more competitive with aluminum, wood and steel products. Armen estimated the upturn in the chemical business could last as long as four or five years, provided the U.S. economy continues its modest rate of growth.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Houston_Astros	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Houston_Texans	http://dbpedia.org/resource/University_of_Houston	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Whitney_Houston	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Houston_Chronicle	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Houston_Rockets	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Houston_Dynamo	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Greater_Houston	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sam_Houston	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Downtown_Houston	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Houston_Comets	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Houston_Press	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Houston_Cougars_football	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Houston_County,_Texas	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Houston_Independent_School_District	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sam_Houston_State_University	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Fort_Sam_Houston	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Museum_of_Fine_Arts,_Houston	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Houston_Grand_Opera	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Houston_Aeros_(WHA)
La Pampa	1749	1757	http://dbpedia.org/resource/La_Pampa_Province	Argentine grain producers adjusted their yield estimates for the 1986/87 coarse grain crop downward in the week to yesterday after the heavy rains at the end of March and beginning of April, trade sources said. They said sunflower, maize and sorghum production estimates had been reduced despite some later warm, dry weather, which has allowed a return to harvesting in some areas. However, as showers fell intermittently after last weekend, producers feared another spell of prolonged and intense rain could cause more damage to crops already badly hit this season. Rains in the middle of last week reached an average of 27 millimetres in parts of Buenos Aires province, 83 mm in Cordoba, 41 in Santa Fe, 50 in Entre Rios and Misiones, 95 in Corrientes, eight in Chaco and 35 in Formosa. There was no rainfall in the same period in La Pampa. Producers feared continued damp conditions could produce rotting and lead to still lower yield estimates for all the crops, including soybean. However, as the lands began drying later in the week harvesting advanced considerably, reaching between 36 and 40 pct of the area sown in the case of sunflower. Deterioration of the sunflower crop evident in harvested material in Cordoba, La Pampa and Buenos Aires forced yield estimates per hectare to be adjusted down again. The seasons sunflowerseed production is now forecast at 2.1 mln to 2.3 mln tonnes, against 2.2 mln to 2.4 mln forecast last week and down 43.9 to 48.8 pct on the 1985/86 record of 4.1 mln. Area sown to sunflowers was two to 2.2 mln hectares, 29.9 to 36.3 pct below the record 3.14 mln hectares last season. Maize harvesting has also reached 36 to 40 pct of the area sown. It is near completion in Cordoba and Santa Fe and will begin in La Pampa and southern Buenos Aires later in April. Production estimates for maize were down from last week at 9.5 mln to 9.8 mln tonnes, against 9.6 mln to 9.9 mln estimated previously. This is 22.2 to 23.4 pct below the 12.4 mln to 12.6 mln tonnes estimated by private sources for the 1985/86 crop and 21.9 to 25.8 pct down on the official figure of 12.8 mln tonnes. Maize was sown on 3.58 mln to 3.78 mln hectares, two to seven pct down on last seasons 3.85 mln. Sorghum was harvested on 23 to 25 pct of the area sown in Cordoba, Santa Fe and Chaco. Harvest will start in La Pampa and Buenos Aires in mid-April. The total area sown was 1.23 mln to 1.30 mln hectares, 10.3 to 15.2 pct down on the 1.45 mln sown last season. The new forecast for the sorghum crop is 2.9 mln to 3.2 mln tonnes compared with three mln to 3.3 mln forecast last week, and is 23.8 to 29.3 pct down on last seasons 4.1 mln to 4.2 mln tonne crop. The soybean crop for this season was not adjusted, remaining at a record 7.5 mln to 7.7 mln tonnes, up 4.2 to 5.5 pct on the 7.2 mln to 7.3 mln estimated by private sources for 1985/86 and 5.6 to 8.5 pct higher than the official figure of 7.1 mln. The area sown to soybeans this season was a record 3.7 mln to 3.8 mln hectares, 10.8 to 13.8 pct up on the record 3.34 mln sown in 1985/86. The soybean crop is showing excessive moisture in some areas and producers fear they may discover more damage. Some experimental harvesting was carried out in Santa Fe on areas making up only about one pct of the total crop but details on this were not available. Preparation of the fields for the 1987/88 wheat crop, which will be sown between May and August or September, has so far not been as intense as in previous years.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/La_Liga	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Las_Vegas	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Las_Vegas_Valley	http://dbpedia.org/resource/La_Paz	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pays_de_la_Loire	http://dbpedia.org/resource/La_Scala	http://dbpedia.org/resource/La_Rioja_(Spain)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/La_Rochelle	http://dbpedia.org/resource/La_Paz_Department_(Bolivia)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/La_Plata	http://dbpedia.org/resource/La_Spezia	http://dbpedia.org/resource/LA_Weekly	http://dbpedia.org/resource/La_Crosse,_Wisconsin	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Las_Vegas_Strip	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Las_Palmas	http://dbpedia.org/resource/La_bohème	http://dbpedia.org/resource/La_traviata	http://dbpedia.org/resource/La_Trobe_University	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Estudiantes_de_La_Plata	http://dbpedia.org/resource/La_Libertad_Region

John Sandner	1334	1346	http://dbpedia.org/resource/John_F._Sandner	The Chicago Mercantile Exchange, CME, said it has added a new chief compliance officer and will expand its regulatory surveillance program. Paul OKelly, currently assistant regional administrator of the Securities and Exchange Commission, was named vice-president of compliance for the exchange, the CME said. The expanded compliance program, which calls for an increase in the exchanges compliance budget and addition of staff, was in response to recent criticisms that the CMEs current surveillance was not able to keep up with increased demands of recent volatility and volume, the CME said. The new surveillance program calls for the addition of three floor investigators and five compliance investigators, the CME said. Some of the new staff will monitor the exchanges new Computerized Trade Reconstruction system, scheduled to start July 1. In addition, three computer programmers will be added to assist in regulatory support for the exchanges management information system department. Recent criticism has been especially directed at the CMEs Standard and Poors stock index futures and options division. A special membership referendum to prohibit CME members from filling customer orders and trading for their own account in S and P 500 futures and options will be voted on April 13. In a letter dated March 12, CME chairman John Sandner and Executive committee chairman Leo Melamed urged members to reject the referendum in favor a series of new rules. Included in the rule changes was the requirement that futures brokers in the S and P pit manually record all personal trades to the nearest minute, intended to enhance the effectiveness of surveillance and compliance functions, We made a promise to our members that we have kept, Melamed said in a release today.

Burlington	2344	2354	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Burlington_Industries	The largest U.S. textile maker focused on its own business as its competitors found merger partners, but now Burlington Industries Inc may have restructured itself into an attractive takeover candidate, analysts said. The takeover spotlight fell today on Burlington, which rose 4-7/8 to 52-7/8 on speculation that investor Asher Edelman and Dominion Textiles Inc of Canada bought an almost five pct stake. A published report said Edelman and Dominion jointly acquired a stake in Burlington and were weighing a takeover offer. Edelman would not comment, and a spokesman for Montreal-based Dominion called the report just rumors. Burlington said it did not know if the report was true. Wall Street professionals said they were not convinced of the story or that Edelman and Dominion would be the victors if Burlington actually came into play. Arbitragers said past comments from Dominion, however, added credence to the speculation. Dominion has said that it was looking for a takeover in the U.S. Last year, Dominion unsuccessfully bid for Avondale Mills and has maintained a 120 mln dlr line of credit to be used for a U.S. acquisition. A Dominion spokesman said Canadas largest textile producer has been negotiating with many U.S. textile companies, but would not say whether Burlington was among them. There have been acquisitions in this area. Its not unusual that someone could be looking at Burlington after the housecleaning theyve done, said Eileen Gormley of Thomson McKinnon. Burlington sold its domestic operations, which made sheets and other linens, to J.P. Stevens and Co Inc for 110 mln dlrs last year. It also has reorganized management, and focused its operations on businesses that would be less affected by foreign competition, Gormley said. Theyve pulled back so as not to be a commodity marketer, said Gormley. She said in moving more heavily into industrial fabrics, Burlington bought C.H. Masland, which supplies carpets and other fabric to the auto industry. In the past, they just spent and never realized the return on the outlays they did make, she said. You look at their record over the year, and I think theyre poised to be more profitable than they had been in the past, Gormley said. She estimated 1987 earnings of 2.50 dlrs per share, up from 2.01 dlrs per share. Some analysts today recommended clients not buy Burlington at its current levels. Edward Johnson of Johnson Redbook said he recommends selling. He said he believes the stock is worth only about 50 dlrs on a takeover basis and about 46 dlrs on an earnings basis. Some arbitragers, however, said takeover values have been placed on the company of 60 to 65 dlrs per share. After Ashers (Edelman) recent history, a lot of people dont find him very credible anymore, said one arbitrager. Another, however, said Edelman succeeds in forcing managements to take steps to enhance shareholder values even if he doesnt win the target company. Edelman was unsuccessful last year in offers for Lucky Stores Inc and Fruehauf Corp. He did succeed in buying Ponderosa Inc. The stocks of other textile makers rose along with Burlington. J.P. Stevens STN climbed 5/8 to 44-7/8, and Fieldcrest Cannon Inc FLD, the result of a merger of Fieldcrest and Cannon, rose 1-1/8 to 39-3/4. West Point-Pepperell Inc WPM rose 1-7/8 to 67-1/8.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Burlington,_Vermont	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Burlington,_Ontario	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Burlington,_Iowa	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Burlington_County,_New_Jersey	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Burlington,_North_Carolina	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Chicago,_Burlington_and_Quincy_Railroad	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Burlington_Northern_Railroad	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Burlington,_New_Jersey	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Burlington,_Massachusetts	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Burlington,_Wisconsin	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Burlington_Coat_Factory	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Burlington_House	http://dbpedia.org/resource/The_Burlington_Magazine	http://dbpedia.org/resource/South_Burlington,_Vermont	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Burlington,_Colorado	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Burlington_Bees	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Burlington_Arcade	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Burlington,_Connecticut	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Burlington,_Kentucky	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Burlington,_Washington

Buenos Aires	1771	1783	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Buenos_Aires_Province	Argentine grain producers adjusted their yield estimates for the 1986/87 coarse grain crop downward in the week to yesterday after the heavy rains at the end of March and beginning of April, trade sources said. They said sunflower, maize and sorghum production estimates had been reduced despite some later warm, dry weather, which has allowed a return to harvesting in some areas. However, as showers fell intermittently after last weekend, producers feared another spell of prolonged and intense rain could cause more damage to crops already badly hit this season. Rains in the middle of last week reached an average of 27 millimetres in parts of Buenos Aires province, 83 mm in Cordoba, 41 in Santa Fe, 50 in Entre Rios and Misiones, 95 in Corrientes, eight in Chaco and 35 in Formosa. There was no rainfall in the same period in La Pampa. Producers feared continued damp conditions could produce rotting and lead to still lower yield estimates for all the crops, including soybean. However, as the lands began drying later in the week harvesting advanced considerably, reaching between 36 and 40 pct of the area sown in the case of sunflower. Deterioration of the sunflower crop evident in harvested material in Cordoba, La Pampa and Buenos Aires forced yield estimates per hectare to be adjusted down again. The seasons sunflowerseed production is now forecast at 2.1 mln to 2.3 mln tonnes, against 2.2 mln to 2.4 mln forecast last week and down 43.9 to 48.8 pct on the 1985/86 record of 4.1 mln. Area sown to sunflowers was two to 2.2 mln hectares, 29.9 to 36.3 pct below the record 3.14 mln hectares last season. Maize harvesting has also reached 36 to 40 pct of the area sown. It is near completion in Cordoba and Santa Fe and will begin in La Pampa and southern Buenos Aires later in April. Production estimates for maize were down from last week at 9.5 mln to 9.8 mln tonnes, against 9.6 mln to 9.9 mln estimated previously. This is 22.2 to 23.4 pct below the 12.4 mln to 12.6 mln tonnes estimated by private sources for the 1985/86 crop and 21.9 to 25.8 pct down on the official figure of 12.8 mln tonnes. Maize was sown on 3.58 mln to 3.78 mln hectares, two to seven pct down on last seasons 3.85 mln. Sorghum was harvested on 23 to 25 pct of the area sown in Cordoba, Santa Fe and Chaco. Harvest will start in La Pampa and Buenos Aires in mid-April. The total area sown was 1.23 mln to 1.30 mln hectares, 10.3 to 15.2 pct down on the 1.45 mln sown last season. The new forecast for the sorghum crop is 2.9 mln to 3.2 mln tonnes compared with three mln to 3.3 mln forecast last week, and is 23.8 to 29.3 pct down on last seasons 4.1 mln to 4.2 mln tonne crop. The soybean crop for this season was not adjusted, remaining at a record 7.5 mln to 7.7 mln tonnes, up 4.2 to 5.5 pct on the 7.2 mln to 7.3 mln estimated by private sources for 1985/86 and 5.6 to 8.5 pct higher than the official figure of 7.1 mln. The area sown to soybeans this season was a record 3.7 mln to 3.8 mln hectares, 10.8 to 13.8 pct up on the record 3.34 mln sown in 1985/86. The soybean crop is showing excessive moisture in some areas and producers fear they may discover more damage. Some experimental harvesting was carried out in Santa Fe on areas making up only about one pct of the total crop but details on this were not available. Preparation of the fields for the 1987/88 wheat crop, which will be sown between May and August or September, has so far not been as intense as in previous years.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Buenos_Aires	http://dbpedia.org/resource/University_of_Buenos_Aires	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Greater_Buenos_Aires	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Buenos_Aires_Underground	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Partidos_of_Buenos_Aires	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Palermo,_Buenos_Aires	http://dbpedia.org/resource/San_Isidro,_Buenos_Aires	http://dbpedia.org/resource/River_Aire	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Morón,_Buenos_Aires	http://dbpedia.org/resource/ATP_Buenos_Aires	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Belgrano,_Buenos_Aires	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Unión_de_Rugby_de_Buenos_Aires	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Estudiantes_de_Buenos_Aires	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Line_E_(Buenos_Aires_Underground)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Recoleta,_Buenos_Aires	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Moreno,_Buenos_Aires	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Junín,_Buenos_Aires	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tigre,_Buenos_Aires	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Buenos_Aires_Cabildo	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Retiro,_Buenos_Aires
Hong Kong	843	852	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hong_Kong	Britain intends to negotiate further agreements on international securities regulation to match those now in force with the U.S. And Japan, government sources said. The Department of Trade and Industry said earlier it had concluded a memorandum of understanding with Japans Finance Ministry to swap supervisory and investigatory information. The agreement covers stocks, shares and government bonds, but not commodity futures, whose regulation in Japan does not come under the Finance Ministry. It therefore does not cover some transactions on the London International Financial Futures Exchange and the London commodities and metal exchanges. The DTI said it hoped to seek further understandings with other countries which met in the U.K. Last December. The meeting involved delegates from the U.K., Switzerland, the U.S., Canada, Australia, Hong Kong, Japan, France, West Germany and Holland. Government sources said the deal with Japan completes arrangements linking Tokyo, the U.S. And London. A U.K. Agreement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) was signed last September. Todays agreement will deal with requests for information on a case by case basis, U.K. Government sources said.

Oil companies such as Ashland Oil Inc (ASH), the Kentucky-based oil refiner and marketer, are also shopping for money-making petrochemical businesses to buy. I see us poised at the threshold of a golden period, said Paul Oreffice, chairman of giant Dow Chemical Co (DOW), adding, Theres no major plant capacity being added around the world now. The whole game is bringing out new products and improving the old ones. Analysts say the chemical industrys biggest customers, automobile manufacturers and home builders that use a lot of paints and plastics, are expected to buy quantities this year. U.S. petrochemical plants are currently operating at about 90 pct capacity, reflecting tighter supply that could hike product prices by 30 to 40 pct this year, said John Dosher, managing director of Pace Consultants Inc of Houston. Demand for some products such as styrene could push profit margins up by as much as 300 pct, he said. Oreffice, speaking at a meeting of chemical engineers in Houston, said Dow would easily top the 741 mln dlrs it earned last year and predicted it would have the best year in its history. In 1985, when oil prices were still above 25 dlrs a barrel and chemical exports were adversely affected by the strong U.S. dollar, Dow had profits of 58 mln dlrs. I believe the entire chemical industry is headed for a record year or close to it, Oreffice said. GAF chairman Samuel Heyman estimated that the U.S. chemical industry would report a 20 pct gain in profits during 1987. Last year, the domestic industry earned a total of 13 billion dlrs, a 54 pct leap from 1985. The turn in the fortunes of the once-sickly chemical industry has been brought about by a combination of luck and planning, said Paces John Dosher. Dosher said last years fall in oil prices made feedstocks dramatically cheaper and at the same time the American dollar was weakening against foreign currencies. That helped boost U.S. chemical exports. Also helping to bring supply and demand into balance has been the gradual market absorption of the extra chemical manufacturing capacity created by Middle Eastern oil producers in the early 1980s. Finally, virtually all major U.S. chemical manufacturers have embarked on an extensive corporate restructuring program to mothball inefficient plants, trim the payroll and eliminate unrelated businesses. The restructuring touched off a flurry of friendly and hostile takeover attempts. GAF, which made an unsuccessful attempt in 1985 to acquire Union Carbide Corp UK, recently offered three billion dlrs for Borg Warner Corp BOR, a Chicago manufacturer of plastics and chemicals. Another industry powerhouse, W.R. Grace (GRA) has divested its retailing, restaurant and fertilizer businesses to raise cash for chemical acquisitions. But some experts worry that the chemical industry may be headed for trouble if companies continue turning their back on the manufacturing of staple petrochemical commodities, such as ethylene, in favor of more profitable specialty chemicals that are custom-designed for a small group of buyers. Companies like DuPont (DD) and Monsanto Co MTC spent the past two or three years trying to get out of the commodity chemical business in reaction to how badly the market had deteriorated, Dosher said. But I think they will eventually kill the margins on the profitable chemicals in the niche market. Some top chemical executives share the concern. The challenge for our industry is to keep from getting carried away and repeating past mistakes, GAFs Heyman cautioned. The shift from commodity chemicals may be ill-advised. Specialty businesses do not stay special long. Houston-based Cain Chemical, created this month by the Sterling investment banking group, believes it can generate 700 mln dlrs in annual sales by bucking the industry trend. Chairman Gordon Cain, who previously led a leveraged buyout of Duponts Conoco Incs chemical business, has spent 1.1 billion dlrs since January to buy seven petrochemical plants along the Texas Gulf Coast. The plants produce only basic commodity petrochemicals that are the building blocks of specialty products. This kind of commodity chemical business will never be a glamorous, high-margin business, Cain said, adding that demand is expected to grow by about three pct annually. Garo Armen, an analyst with Dean Witter Reynolds, said chemical makers have also benefitted by increasing demand for plastics as prices become more competitive with aluminum, wood and steel products. Armen estimated the upturn in the chemical business could last as long as four or five years, provided the U.S. economy continues its modest rate of growth.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Chemical_reaction	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Chemical_compound	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Chemical_formula	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Chemical_engineering	http://dbpedia.org/resource/American_Chemical_Society	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Chemical_element	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Chemical_synthesis	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Chemical_Abstracts_Service	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Chemical_industry	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Chemical_bond	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Chemical_structure	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Chemical_warfare	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Imperial_Chemical_Industries	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Chemical_engineer	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Chemical_substance	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Chemical_kinetics	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Chemical_equilibrium	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Chemical_weapon	http://dbpedia.org/resource/My_Chemical_Romance	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Chemical_polarity
Georgia Power	713	726	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Georgia_Power	An audit submitted to the Georgia Public Service Commission claims that between 944 mln dlrs and 1.8 billion dlrs of the costs of the Plant Vogtle nuclear power station should be disallowed, a Southern Co spokeswoman said. Southerns Georgia Power Co subsidiary has a 45.7 pct interest in the plant and estimated earlier this year it would cost a total of 8.87 billion dlrs. Last year, the plants owners pledged to Georgia regulators they would limit the cost passed on to rate payers to 8.4 billion dlrs. The Southern spokeswoman said the company feels the report by OBrien-Kreitzberg is flawed and biased. She said the report was released yesterday by the state attorney general. Responding to the report today, Georgia Power Chairman Robert W. Scherer told a news conference the conclusions drawn by the firm are not only wrong -- they also reflect the same bias against nuclear power that these auditors have demonstrated in similar cases accross the country. Saying he was not suggesting Georgia power was without fault, Scherer said the audit identified several things I wish we had done differently. Scherer pointed out a report OBrien-Kreitzberg submitted to Georgia regulators in March 1986 projected Georgia Power would not finish Plant Vogtle unit one before the end of 1987. Noting unit one is finished, and we expect it to be in commercial operationg by June, he said the firms latest report ignored the earlier projection, gave the utility no credit for the completion and actually penalized us by suggesting that costs to maintain t he schedule be disallowed. Scherer said the latest audit alleges Georgia Power could have saved 95 mln dlrs if it had stopped using four shifts, seven days a week to speed construction three years sooner. He said this would have delayed completion of the plant for another year and it would have cost several hunderd million dlrs more. Noting the audit said costs were increased 600 mln dlrs by schedule delays totaling 20.5 months, he said First, we have the best concrete placement record in the industry, Second new government regulations after the Three Mile Island incident significantly increased construction time.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Georgia_(country)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Georgia_(U.S._state)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Power_metal	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Savannah,_Georgia	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Power_pop	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Power_forward_(basketball)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/University_of_Georgia	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Athens,_Georgia	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Macon,_Georgia	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Augusta,_Georgia	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Columbus,_Georgia	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Nuclear_power	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Power_station	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Georgia_Institute_of_Technology	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Solar_power	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Axis_powers	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Wind_power	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Marietta,_Georgia	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Electric_power	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Effective_radiated_power
Brazil	443	449	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Brazil	Storage problems with Brazils record grain crop are likely to result in losses of about five mln tonnes, an Agriculture Ministry spokesman said. Ministry spokesman Leonardo Brito, speaking from Brasilia, told Reuters he believed that about five mln tonnes of this years estimated crop of 65 mln tonnes would be lost. He said part of this would be the normal loss inevitable in harvesting, but that most of it would stem from storage problems. Brazil has a storage capacity of 66 mln tonnes, theoretically sufficient for the crop. But Brito said that the storage capacity was badly distributed. The states of Sao Paulo, Parana and Rio Grande do Sul had between them 70 pct of the nations capacity, but were responsible for only 50 to 60 pct of production. The biggest problems are concentrated in the Centre-West growing regions, where rising production has outpaced storage capacity. Brito said the Centre-West, whose crops include soya and maize, had between 30 and 40 pct of the nations grains production but only 20 pct of its storage space. In addition to the poor distribution of storage units, there is the problem that too much of the capacity is geared to storing grain in sacks, while not enough is suitable for storing loose grain, Brito said. Finally, there is a shortage of lorries to transport the crops. The sheer scale of the task in transporting the record crop has been evident from television reports, which have shown enormous queues of lorries waiting outside granaries.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/States_of_Brazil	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Municipalities_of_Brazil	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Regions_of_Brazil	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Northeast_Region,_Brazil	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Brazil_national_football_team	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Southeast_Region,_Brazil	http://dbpedia.org/resource/South_Region,_Brazil	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ministry_of_Transport_(Brazil)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Time_in_Brazil	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Federal_District_(Brazil)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Colonial_Brazil	http://dbpedia.org/resource/President_of_Brazil	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Workers'_Party_(Brazil)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mesoregions_of_Brazil	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Empire_of_Brazil	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Microregions_of_Brazil	http://dbpedia.org/resource/North_Region,_Brazil	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Central-West_Region,_Brazil	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Football_in_Brazil	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pedro_II_of_Brazil

Miller	884	890	http://dbpedia.org/resource/James_C._Miller_III	Office of Management and Budget Director James Miller said President Reagan will reject the tax increase called for in the House Budget Committees 1988 budget proposal which is before the House for a vote today. Its just completely unacceptable, Miller told a House Appropriations subcommittee on Treasury, Postal Service and General Government Appropriations. The plan, drafted by the Democratic-controlled Budget committee, calls for 22 billion dlrs in higher revenues, of which 18 billion would be from new taxes set by the tax-writing committees. The House committees budget proposal includes some increases in federal user fees as well as 18 billion dlrs in taxes. Miller warned that failure to reduce the federal deficit would jeopardize the U.S. economy. If we do not further reduce the deficit... we place this economic expansion that weve had in the last five years at risk, Miller told the subcommittee. The result of any kind of tax increase would be to increase substantially the prospects that the expansion would come to an end, Miller said.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Arthur_Miller	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Glenn_Miller	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Miller	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Marcus_Miller	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Henry_Miller	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Roger_Miller	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Philip_Miller	http://dbpedia.org/resource/P._Schuyler_Miller	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Barney_Miller	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Gerrit_Smith_Miller	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dennis_Miller	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mac_Miller	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ben_Millers	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Frank_Miller_(comics)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Minneapolis_Millers	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mitch_Miller	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Jonathan_Miller	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ernest_Miller_(cinematographer)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Steve_Miller_Band	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sienna_Miller

DSM chairman Hans van Liemt told journalists We have done our homework. Were ready. It is up to the state now. He said a public sale of 30 pct of DSMs assets in 1988 was not unlikely, but the timing of the sell-off was entirely in the hands of Parliament. Dutch Finance Minister Onno Ruding is known to be a proponent of privatisation, and the centre-right government coalition mentioned plans to privatise DSM in its policy declaration last autumn. Van Liemt would not speculate on a possible market price, but said his company had raised its total 1986 dividend to 98 mln guilders, almost 25 pct of 1986 net profit. We ought to be able to match our German competitors on price earnings ratio, although the Amsterdam bourse generally has a lower ratio than the worlds major exchanges,  he said. The average Dutch price/earnings ratio is 10.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Amsterdam	http://dbpedia.org/resource/University_of_Amsterdam	http://dbpedia.org/resource/New_Amsterdam	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Amsterdam_Admirals	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Amsterdam_Marathon	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Amsterdam_Airport_Schiphol	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Paradiso_(Amsterdam)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/International_Documentary_Film_Festival_Amsterdam	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Amsterdam_Arena	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Olympic_Stadium_(Amsterdam)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Amsterdam_Metro	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Stedelijk_Museum_Amsterdam	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Conservatorium_van_Amsterdam	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Amsterdam_Museum	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Amsterdam-Zuid	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Vrije_Universiteit_Amsterdam	http://dbpedia.org/resource/IJ_(Amsterdam)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/New_Amsterdam,_Guyana	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Amsterdam_School	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Paris_Bourse

Texaco Inc	69	79	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Chevron_Corporation	First Boston Corp analyst William Randol recommended the purchase of Texaco Inc today, saying the discount that investors have made in the share price to reflect the ongoing litigation with Pennzoil has been overdone relative to how we expect the case to conclude. Texacos stock rose 1/8 to 34-1/8. On Monday, the stock tumbled four points after the Supreme Court overturned a lower court decision that cut Texacos bond in the 10.3 billion dlr legal dispute with Pennzoil Co PZL to one billion dlrs. Yesterday, a Texas court granted a temporary injunction on the bond issue pending a hearing next week. The current litigation arose from Texacos buyout of Getty Oil Co in 1984. Pennzoil sued, arguing its earlier agreement to buy Getty was binding. Two Texas state courts upheld Pennzoils position. Randol, noting that the stock has suffered a great deal in the two years since the litigation was filed, said we recognize the legal problems but think investors have overdone it. He said the stock is selling at 48 pct of its asset value, and we think it represents a good value at this level.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Chevron_U.S.A.,_Inc._v._Natural_Resources_Defense_Council,_Inc.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Utah_Dineh_Corporation_Inc	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Lingle_v._Chevron_U.S.A._Inc.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Intel_Corporation_Inc._v._CPM_United_Kingdom_Ltd	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Magnan_v._Anaconda_Industries,_Inc.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cafection_Enterprises_Inc.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hunger_Task_Force,_Inc.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Independent_Natural_Resources,_Inc	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Kingdomware_Technologies,_Inc._v._United_States	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mochila_Inc.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mimeo,_Inc	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Board_of_Certification,_Inc.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/After_the_War_(Mono_Inc._album)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Systematics,_Inc	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Entergy_Corp._v._Riverkeeper_Inc.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/American_Radio_Relay_League,_Inc._v._FCC	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Henningsen_v._Bloomfield_Motors,_Inc.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Oxbridge_Academy_Foundation,_Inc.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Photronics_Inc	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Nady_Systems,_Inc.

Federal member of parliament for the region,  Charles-Eugene Marin, said last week the federal government is also prepared to provide financial help to restart operations as soon as possible. Noranda has estimated damage from the fire at about 10 mln dlrs and a company spokesman said it should have a more specific estimate by the end of the month. Noranda said it had hoped to have an estimate sooner, but has found that it will take longer than expected to gain access to the burned-out area.

Japan	854	859	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Japan	Britain intends to negotiate further agreements on international securities regulation to match those now in force with the U.S. And Japan, government sources said. The Department of Trade and Industry said earlier it had concluded a memorandum of understanding with Japans Finance Ministry to swap supervisory and investigatory information. The agreement covers stocks, shares and government bonds, but not commodity futures, whose regulation in Japan does not come under the Finance Ministry. It therefore does not cover some transactions on the London International Financial Futures Exchange and the London commodities and metal exchanges. The DTI said it hoped to seek further understandings with other countries which met in the U.K. Last December.

U.S	124	127	http://dbpedia.org/resource/United_States	Britain intends to negotiate further agreements on international securities regulation to match those now in force with the U.S. And Japan, government sources said. The Department of Trade and Industry said earlier it had concluded a memorandum of understanding with Japans Finance Ministry to swap supervisory and investigatory information. The agreement covers stocks, shares and government bonds, but not commodity futures, whose regulation in Japan does not come under the Finance Ministry. It therefore does not cover some transactions on the London International Financial Futures Exchange and the London commodities and metal exchanges. The DTI said it hoped to seek further understandings with other countries which met in the U.K. Last December. The meeting involved delegates from the U.K., Switzerland, the U.S., Canada, Australia, Hong Kong, Japan, France, West Germany and Holland. Government sources said the deal with Japan completes arrangements linking Tokyo, the U.S. And London.

Iran	0	4	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Iran	Iran decided to continue its operations east of Basra to destroy Iraqs forces, Iranian Prime Minister Mir-Hossein Mousavi told Tehran Radio. That seems to be the best spot for the complete destruction of (Iraqi President) Saddams forces. This is why it was decided that the operations would forcefully continue there, he said. At the same time, we have maintained our ability to act throughout the length of the fronts, Mousavi told the radio, monitored by the British Broadcasting Corporation. Tehran Radio reported over 1,500 Iraqi casualties today as Iran continued its Karbala-8 operation launched early yesterday. Iran said over 2,600 Iraqis had been killed or wounded yesterday. Iraq said today its forces had beaten back the latest attacks inflicting heavy casualties. Mousavi told Tehran radio that on the whole, our advances have broken the back of the military forces of Saddam. Earlier today the Iranian news agency IRNA said Tehrans forces were stabilising new positions after their assault on Iraqi lines defending Basra, Iraqs second city. In Baghdad, a military spokesman said Iraqi warplanes today destroyed an oil pumping station and a production unit at Irans Ahvaz field.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Provinces_of_Iran	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Counties_of_Iran	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Iran_Standard_Time	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Iran–Iraq_War	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Iran_national_football_team	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Arak,_Iran	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Azerbaijan_(Iran)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cinema_of_Iran	http://dbpedia.org/resource/President_of_Iran	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Rey,_Iran	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Iran_hostage_crisis	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Zanjan,_Iran	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sari,_Iran	http://dbpedia.org/resource/2013–14_Iran_Pro_League	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Prime_Minister_of_Iran	http://dbpedia.org/resource/History_of_Iran	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sarband_District_(Iran)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Supreme_Leader_of_Iran	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Music_of_Iran	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Greater_Iran

London Metal Exchange	507	528	http://dbpedia.org/resource/London_Metal_Exchange	The Association of White Metals has decided to publish a daily tin price here in French francs per 100 kilos, the French Federation of Non-Ferrous Metals said. The price, quoted for the first time yesterday, was introduced as the lack of tin quotes was causing problems for some French companies, a spokesman for the non-ferrous metals association said. Todays price was set at 4,776 francs per 100 kilos and Tuesdays at 4,790. The International Chamber of Commerce stopped publishing a tin price after the London Metal Exchange (LME) stopped tin trading on October 24, 1985. The Association has tested the basis it uses to calculate a French franc price over the last few months to ensure it was reliable, the spokesman said. The French franc price is pre-tax, for specified quality, a minimum 99.9 pct purity, at a French port or border railway station and a minimum delivery of 10 tonnes. The French Federation of Non-Ferrous Metals groups various metal associations including the Association of White Metals.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/London	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Heavy_metal_music	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Death_metal	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thrash_metal	http://dbpedia.org/resource/University_of_London	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Black_metal	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Metal	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Progressive_metal	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Alternative_metal	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Power_metal	http://dbpedia.org/resource/London,_Ontario	http://dbpedia.org/resource/London_Stock_Exchange	http://dbpedia.org/resource/University_College_London	http://dbpedia.org/resource/King's_College_London	http://dbpedia.org/resource/City_of_London	http://dbpedia.org/resource/London_School_of_Economics	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Doom_metal	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Greater_London	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Nu_metal	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Industrial_metal
Dr. Steven Rosenberg	1852	1872	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Steven_Rosenberg	Promising new findings in the use of a controversial experimental drug called Interleukin-2 as a cure for cancer will be published in the April 9 issue of the prestigious New England Journal of Medicine, according to a Wall Street analyst who has obtained an advance copy of the magazine. Among interleukins principal U. S. makers are Cetus Corp CTUS, headquartered in Emeryville, Calif., and Immunex Corp IMNX, based in Seattle, Wash. The journal, to be released late today, contains two articles reporting high remission rates several cancer types. The journal also contains a signed editorial concluding that the new results mark a significant milestone in the search for a successful immunotherapy for cancer. Interleukin-2, also known as IL-2, is a substance naturally produced by living cells in the laboratory. The drug is controversial because it was widely praised as a promising cancer treatment in early reports on its effectiveness in late 1985, only to come under criticism a year later for its failure to live up to its promise and due to its ravaging side effects. One of the new studies, conducted by Dr. William West of Biotherapeutics Inc of Franklin, Tenn., is particularly significant because it found far fewer harsh side effects after it changed the way in which the drug is administered. In that study, researchers administered IL-2 to 48 cancer patients and found a 50-pct remission rate for kidney cancers and a 50 pct remission rate for melanoma, a type of skin cancer, according to Prudential-Bache Securities Stuart Weisbrod, who obtained the advance copy of the magazine. For rectal and colon cancer, the researchers found no remissions, but none of the 48 patients treated had side effects serious enough to be placed under intensive hospital care, according to the article. In the second study, whose principal author is Dr. Steven Rosenberg of the National Cancer Institute, researchers administered IL-2 to 157 cancer patients and found a 33 pct remission rate in cancers of the kidney, a 27 pct rate in melanomas and a 15 pct rate in cancers of the colon and rectum. In the National Cancer Institute trials, a total of four patients died, the magazine reported, confirming the harshness of the drugs side effects as originally administered. Perhaps we are at the end of the beginning of the search for successful immunotherapy for cancer, said the editorial, signed by John Durant of Philadelphias Chase Cancer Center. These observations reported by Rosenberg and West surely did not describe successful practical approaches ready for widespread applications in the therapy of cancer patients, the editorial said. On the other hand, if they reflect, as seems possible, a successful manipulation of the cellular immune system, then we may be near the end of our search for a meaningful direction in the immunuotherapy of cancer, the editorial concluded.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Steven_Spielberg	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Steven_Tyler	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Steven_Seagal	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Steven_Soderbergh	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Steven_Wilson	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Steven_Pinker	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Steven_Berkoff	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Alfred_Rosenberg	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Brett_Steven	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Steven_Runciman	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Willow_Rosenberg	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Steven_Diez	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Steven_Gerrard	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Steven_Curtis_Chapman	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Steven_Goldmann	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Steven_Moffat	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Steven_Blum	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Steven_Bauer	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Steven_Meisel	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Steven_Holl

Heyman	4016	4022	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Samuel_J._Heyman	Cheap oil feedstocks, the weakened U.S. dollar and a plant utilization rate approaching 90 pct will propel the streamlined U.S. petrochemical industry to record profits this year, with growth expected through at least 1990, major company executives predicted. This bullish outlook for chemical manufacturing and an industrywide move to shed unrelated businesses has prompted GAF Corp (GAF), privately-held Cain Chemical Inc, and other firms to aggressively seek acquisitions of petrochemical plants. Oil companies such as Ashland Oil Inc (ASH), the Kentucky-based oil refiner and marketer, are also shopping for money-making petrochemical businesses to buy. I see us poised at the threshold of a golden period, said Paul Oreffice, chairman of giant Dow Chemical Co (DOW), adding, Theres no major plant capacity being added around the world now. The whole game is bringing out new products and improving the old ones. Analysts say the chemical industrys biggest customers, automobile manufacturers and home builders that use a lot of paints and plastics, are expected to buy quantities this year. U.S. petrochemical plants are currently operating at about 90 pct capacity, reflecting tighter supply that could hike product prices by 30 to 40 pct this year, said John Dosher, managing director of Pace Consultants Inc of Houston. Demand for some products such as styrene could push profit margins up by as much as 300 pct, he said. Oreffice, speaking at a meeting of chemical engineers in Houston, said Dow would easily top the 741 mln dlrs it earned last year and predicted it would have the best year in its history. In 1985, when oil prices were still above 25 dlrs a barrel and chemical exports were adversely affected by the strong U.S. dollar, Dow had profits of 58 mln dlrs. I believe the entire chemical industry is headed for a record year or close to it, Oreffice said. GAF chairman Samuel Heyman estimated that the U.S. chemical industry would report a 20 pct gain in profits during 1987. Last year, the domestic industry earned a total of 13 billion dlrs, a 54 pct leap from 1985. The turn in the fortunes of the once-sickly chemical industry has been brought about by a combination of luck and planning, said Paces John Dosher. Dosher said last years fall in oil prices made feedstocks dramatically cheaper and at the same time the American dollar was weakening against foreign currencies. That helped boost U.S. chemical exports. Also helping to bring supply and demand into balance has been the gradual market absorption of the extra chemical manufacturing capacity created by Middle Eastern oil producers in the early 1980s. Finally, virtually all major U.S. chemical manufacturers have embarked on an extensive corporate restructuring program to mothball inefficient plants, trim the payroll and eliminate unrelated businesses. The restructuring touched off a flurry of friendly and hostile takeover attempts. GAF, which made an unsuccessful attempt in 1985 to acquire Union Carbide Corp UK, recently offered three billion dlrs for Borg Warner Corp BOR, a Chicago manufacturer of plastics and chemicals. Another industry powerhouse, W.R. Grace (GRA) has divested its retailing, restaurant and fertilizer businesses to raise cash for chemical acquisitions. But some experts worry that the chemical industry may be headed for trouble if companies continue turning their back on the manufacturing of staple petrochemical commodities, such as ethylene, in favor of more profitable specialty chemicals that are custom-designed for a small group of buyers. Companies like DuPont (DD) and Monsanto Co MTC spent the past two or three years trying to get out of the commodity chemical business in reaction to how badly the market had deteriorated, Dosher said. But I think they will eventually kill the margins on the profitable chemicals in the niche market. Some top chemical executives share the concern. The challenge for our industry is to keep from getting carried away and repeating past mistakes, GAFs Heyman cautioned. The shift from commodity chemicals may be ill-advised. Specialty businesses do not stay special long. Houston-based Cain Chemical, created this month by the Sterling investment banking group, believes it can generate 700 mln dlrs in annual sales by bucking the industry trend. Chairman Gordon Cain, who previously led a leveraged buyout of Duponts Conoco Incs chemical business, has spent 1.1 billion dlrs since January to buy seven petrochemical plants along the Texas Gulf Coast. The plants produce only basic commodity petrochemicals that are the building blocks of specialty products. This kind of commodity chemical business will never be a glamorous, high-margin business, Cain said, adding that demand is expected to grow by about three pct annually. Garo Armen, an analyst with Dean Witter Reynolds, said chemical makers have also benefitted by increasing demand for plastics as prices become more competitive with aluminum, wood and steel products. Armen estimated the upturn in the chemical business could last as long as four or five years, provided the U.S. economy continues its modest rate of growth.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Edward_Heyman	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Paul_Heyman	http://dbpedia.org/resource/David_Heyman	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Preston_Heyman	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Michelle_Heyman	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Joel_Heyman	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Art_Heyman	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Samuel_J._Heyman_Service_to_America_Medals	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mark_Heyman	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cullman-Heyman_Tennis_Center	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Abigail_Heyman	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Norma_Heyman	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Peter_Heyman	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Jon_Heyman	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Alan_Heyman	http://dbpedia.org/resource/George_Heyman	http://dbpedia.org/resource/John_Heyman	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bruce_Heyman	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sally_A._Heyman	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Richard_A._Heyman

Stockholm	354	363	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Stockholm	Plans to rejuvenate Polands economy by reducing central government control would help reassure Western creditors that the countrys economy was safe to invest in, a senior Polish official said. The business of granting loans to Poland is not as bad a business as you might imagine, senior Polish government spokesman Jerzy Urban told a news conference in Stockholm. Urban, visiting the Swedish capital to deliver a lecture at the Foreign Policy Institute, announced earlier this week that Poland would soon offer shares to private citizens in state companies in a bid to make the economy more responsive. This was part of a major economic reform to be announced in the coming weeks, he said. Urban said the main problem with his countrys foreign debt burden of 32 billion dollars was short term interest charges but the long term looked more secure. He said he hoped talks under way with the Paris Club, grouping Polands main government creditors, would shortly solve the problem of short term servicing. Urban told reporters that debt servicing was hampering the expansion of the national economy, but that the new plans for economic reform would open new vistas for Polish exports. He criticised the blocking efforts of some Western governments, whom he declined to name, for putting political considerations ahead of economic co-operation. After the lifting of U.S. Sanctions against the Polish economy we considered all political obstacles had been removed, but that has not been the case, Urban said.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Stockholm_County	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Stockholm_University	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Stockholm_metro	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Stockholm_Municipality	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Stockholm_archipelago	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Stockholms_Fotbollförbund	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Stockholm_Palace	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Stockholm_School_of_Economics	http://dbpedia.org/resource/IFK_Stockholm	http://dbpedia.org/resource/List_of_Stockholm_metro_stations	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Stockholm_Olympic_Stadium	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Stockholms_KK	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Stockholm_Records	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Stockholm_Stock_Exchange	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Stockholm_syndrome	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Stockholm_Marathon	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Stockholm_International_Film_Festival	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Stockholm_commuter_rail	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Geography_of_Stockholm	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Royal_College_of_Music,_Stockholm
Burlington	1888	1898	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Burlington_Industries	The largest U.S. textile maker focused on its own business as its competitors found merger partners, but now Burlington Industries Inc may have restructured itself into an attractive takeover candidate, analysts said. The takeover spotlight fell today on Burlington, which rose 4-7/8 to 52-7/8 on speculation that investor Asher Edelman and Dominion Textiles Inc of Canada bought an almost five pct stake. A published report said Edelman and Dominion jointly acquired a stake in Burlington and were weighing a takeover offer. Edelman would not comment, and a spokesman for Montreal-based Dominion called the report just rumors. Burlington said it did not know if the report was true. Wall Street professionals said they were not convinced of the story or that Edelman and Dominion would be the victors if Burlington actually came into play. Arbitragers said past comments from Dominion, however, added credence to the speculation. Dominion has said that it was looking for a takeover in the U.S. Last year, Dominion unsuccessfully bid for Avondale Mills and has maintained a 120 mln dlr line of credit to be used for a U.S. acquisition. A Dominion spokesman said Canadas largest textile producer has been negotiating with many U.S. textile companies, but would not say whether Burlington was among them. There have been acquisitions in this area. Its not unusual that someone could be looking at Burlington after the housecleaning theyve done, said Eileen Gormley of Thomson McKinnon. Burlington sold its domestic operations, which made sheets and other linens, to J.P. Stevens and Co Inc for 110 mln dlrs last year. It also has reorganized management, and focused its operations on businesses that would be less affected by foreign competition, Gormley said. Theyve pulled back so as not to be a commodity marketer, said Gormley. She said in moving more heavily into industrial fabrics, Burlington bought C.H. Masland, which supplies carpets and other fabric to the auto industry. In the past, they just spent and never realized the return on the outlays they did make, she said. You look at their record over the year, and I think theyre poised to be more profitable than they had been in the past, Gormley said. She estimated 1987 earnings of 2.50 dlrs per share, up from 2.01 dlrs per share. Some analysts today recommended clients not buy Burlington at its current levels. Edward Johnson of Johnson Redbook said he recommends selling. He said he believes the stock is worth only about 50 dlrs on a takeover basis and about 46 dlrs on an earnings basis. Some arbitragers, however, said takeover values have been placed on the company of 60 to 65 dlrs per share. After Ashers (Edelman) recent history, a lot of people dont find him very credible anymore, said one arbitrager. Another, however, said Edelman succeeds in forcing managements to take steps to enhance shareholder values even if he doesnt win the target company. Edelman was unsuccessful last year in offers for Lucky Stores Inc and Fruehauf Corp. He did succeed in buying Ponderosa Inc. The stocks of other textile makers rose along with Burlington. J.P. Stevens STN climbed 5/8 to 44-7/8, and Fieldcrest Cannon Inc FLD, the result of a merger of Fieldcrest and Cannon, rose 1-1/8 to 39-3/4. West Point-Pepperell Inc WPM rose 1-7/8 to 67-1/8.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Burlington,_Vermont	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Burlington,_Ontario	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Burlington,_Iowa	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Burlington_County,_New_Jersey	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Burlington,_North_Carolina	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Chicago,_Burlington_and_Quincy_Railroad	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Burlington_Northern_Railroad	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Burlington,_New_Jersey	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Burlington,_Massachusetts	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Burlington,_Wisconsin	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Burlington_Coat_Factory	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Burlington_House	http://dbpedia.org/resource/The_Burlington_Magazine	http://dbpedia.org/resource/South_Burlington,_Vermont	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Burlington,_Colorado	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Burlington_Bees	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Burlington_Arcade	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Burlington,_Connecticut	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Burlington,_Kentucky	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Burlington,_Washington
Celanese Corp	505	518	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Celanese	Hoechst Celanese Corp said it sent propsective customers a confidential report describing its polyester textile fiber facilities in North Carolina and South Carolina. The company did not disclose any prices. The report describes the facilities in Darlington County, S.C., and Fayetteville, N.C., the company said. The report also decribes related manufacturing, marketing, administrative and technical resources that could be made avialable to a buyer. Hoechst Celanese was formed Feb 27 by the merger of Celanese Corp and American Hoechst Corp. The merger took place after an agreement was reached with the Federal Trade Commission that certain domestic polyester textile fiber assets of the combined companies would be divested, it said. Hoechst Celanese said it has the option of divesting either the South Carolina facilities of the former American Hoechst or a package of polyester textile fiber facilities of the former Celanese.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/British_Celanese	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Celanese_Theatre	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Isle_of_Man_Civil_Defence_Corps	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pacific_Bearing_Corp	http://dbpedia.org/resource/French_ship_Six_Corps_(1762)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/X_Corps_(United_Kingdom)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Spy_Corps	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Empress_Casino_Joliet_Corp._v._Giannoulias	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Marine_Corps_Planning_Process	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Math_Science_Teaching_Corps	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Entergy_Corp._v._Riverkeeper_Inc.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/XIX_Corps	http://dbpedia.org/resource/United_States_Navy_Dental_Corps	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Kalmykian_Voluntary_Cavalry_Corps	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Delta_Corp_Limited	http://dbpedia.org/resource/National_Security_Corps	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ottendorf's_Corps	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Frontier_Corps	http://dbpedia.org/resource/XXI_Corps_(United_Kingdom)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/4th_Corps_of_the_Army_of_the_Republic_of_Bosnia_and_Herzegovina

Netherlands	1134	1145	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Netherlands	Securities and Exchange Commission John Shad said he wanted Congress to write a better definition of insider trading but thought action should wait until the Supreme Court ruled on an insider trading case. Id like the benefit of the Winans decision before deciding on a definition, Shad told a Senate Appropriations subcommittee hearing. Shad was refering to the appeal by former Wall Street Journal reporter R. Foster Winans of his conviction on insider trading charges for telling a friend in advance what stocks he was going to write about in his column. The stocks usually went up or down in price depending on Winans recommendation. He said insider trading accounted for only 11 percent of the SECs enforcement activities last year despite the publicity given to recent major cases. Insider trading makes up only a tiny fraction of one pct of the 50 billion dlrs of daily securities trading, Shad said. Shad asked for a budget increase so the SEC could enlarge its enforcement staff by 20 this year and 73 next year to deal with all types of securities fraud. Shad said he hoped to start his new duties as U.S. Ambassador to the Netherlands by June. He said he did not know when his successor would be named by President Reagan.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Limburg_(Netherlands)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Netherlands_Antilles	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Provinces_of_the_Netherlands	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Netherlands_national_football_team	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Telephone_numbers_in_the_Netherlands	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Royal_Netherlands_Navy	http://dbpedia.org/resource/List_of_municipalities_of_the_Netherlands	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Southern_Netherlands	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Emmen,_Netherlands	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Spanish_Netherlands	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Labour_Party_(Netherlands)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Kingdom_of_the_Netherlands	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Austrian_Netherlands	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Royal_Netherlands_Academy_of_Arts_and_Sciences	http://dbpedia.org/resource/House_of_Representatives_(Netherlands)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ede,_Netherlands	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Municipal_council_(Netherlands)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Senate_(Netherlands)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Netherlands_national_cricket_team	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Beatrix_of_the_Netherlands

Zambian government	4	22	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Zambia	The Zambian government has no immediate plans to follow last weeks increase in the producer price of maize with a hike in the retail price of maize meal, an official of the ruling party said. Last December, a 120 pct increase in the consumer price for refined maize meal, a Zambian staple, led to food riots in which at least 15 people died. That price increase, which President Kenneth Kaunda later revoked, followed pressure by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to reduce the governments subsidy bill. However, if the producer price rise, from 6.10 dlrs to 8.67 dlrs per 90-kg bag, is not accompanied by a retail price increase, the government will have to spend more on subsidies, a practice discouraged by the IMF. There is no way out but to raise the subsidy levels of meal. It (the government) would have to choose between the demands of the IMF and those of the people, a Ministry of Agriculture economist said.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Government	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Government_of_India	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Government_agency	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Local_government_in_Australia	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Minister_(government)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Local_government	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cabinet_(government)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Government_of_Maharashtra	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Government_of_Australia	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Government_of_Canada	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Scottish_Government	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Executive_(government)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Local_government_in_New_Jersey	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ministry_(government_department)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Local_Government_Act_1972	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Government_of_Pakistan	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Federal_government_of_the_United_States	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Band_government	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Coalition_government	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Government_of_Bangladesh
Emeryville	369	379	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Emeryville,_California	Promising new findings in the use of a controversial experimental drug called Interleukin-2 as a cure for cancer will be published in the April 9 issue of the prestigious New England Journal of Medicine, according to a Wall Street analyst who has obtained an advance copy of the magazine. Among interleukins principal U. S. makers are Cetus Corp CTUS, headquartered in Emeryville, Calif., and Immunex Corp IMNX, based in Seattle, Wash. The journal, to be released late today, contains two articles reporting high remission rates several cancer types. The journal also contains a signed editorial concluding that the new results mark a significant milestone in the search for a successful immunotherapy for cancer. Interleukin-2, also known as IL-2, is a substance naturally produced by living cells in the laboratory. The drug is controversial because it was widely praised as a promising cancer treatment in early reports on its effectiveness in late 1985, only to come under criticism a year later for its failure to live up to its promise and due to its ravaging side effects. One of the new studies, conducted by Dr. William West of Biotherapeutics Inc of Franklin, Tenn., is particularly significant because it found far fewer harsh side effects after it changed the way in which the drug is administered. In that study, researchers administered IL-2 to 48 cancer patients and found a 50-pct remission rate for kidney cancers and a 50 pct remission rate for melanoma, a type of skin cancer, according to Prudential-Bache Securities Stuart Weisbrod, who obtained the advance copy of the magazine. For rectal and colon cancer, the researchers found no remissions, but none of the 48 patients treated had side effects serious enough to be placed under intensive hospital care, according to the article. In the second study, whose principal author is Dr. Steven Rosenberg of the National Cancer Institute, researchers administered IL-2 to 157 cancer patients and found a 33 pct remission rate in cancers of the kidney, a 27 pct rate in melanomas and a 15 pct rate in cancers of the colon and rectum. In the National Cancer Institute trials, a total of four patients died, the magazine reported, confirming the harshness of the drugs side effects as originally administered. Perhaps we are at the end of the beginning of the search for successful immunotherapy for cancer, said the editorial, signed by John Durant of Philadelphias Chase Cancer Center. These observations reported by Rosenberg and West surely did not describe successful practical approaches ready for widespread applications in the therapy of cancer patients, the editorial said. On the other hand, if they reflect, as seems possible, a successful manipulation of the cellular immune system, then we may be near the end of our search for a meaningful direction in the immunuotherapy of cancer, the editorial concluded.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Emeryville_Shellmound	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Shell_Development_Emeryville	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Emeryville_station	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bay_Street_Emeryville	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Emeryville_Crescent_State_Marine_Reserve

Dow	1501	1504	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dow_Chemical_Company	Cheap oil feedstocks, the weakened U.S. dollar and a plant utilization rate approaching 90 pct will propel the streamlined U.S. petrochemical industry to record profits this year, with growth expected through at least 1990, major company executives predicted. This bullish outlook for chemical manufacturing and an industrywide move to shed unrelated businesses has prompted GAF Corp (GAF), privately-held Cain Chemical Inc, and other firms to aggressively seek acquisitions of petrochemical plants. Oil companies such as Ashland Oil Inc (ASH), the Kentucky-based oil refiner and marketer, are also shopping for money-making petrochemical businesses to buy. I see us poised at the threshold of a golden period, said Paul Oreffice, chairman of giant Dow Chemical Co (DOW), adding, Theres no major plant capacity being added around the world now. The whole game is bringing out new products and improving the old ones. Analysts say the chemical industrys biggest customers, automobile manufacturers and home builders that use a lot of paints and plastics, are expected to buy quantities this year. U.S. petrochemical plants are currently operating at about 90 pct capacity, reflecting tighter supply that could hike product prices by 30 to 40 pct this year, said John Dosher, managing director of Pace Consultants Inc of Houston. Demand for some products such as styrene could push profit margins up by as much as 300 pct, he said. Oreffice, speaking at a meeting of chemical engineers in Houston, said Dow would easily top the 741 mln dlrs it earned last year and predicted it would have the best year in its history. In 1985, when oil prices were still above 25 dlrs a barrel and chemical exports were adversely affected by the strong U.S. dollar, Dow had profits of 58 mln dlrs. I believe the entire chemical industry is headed for a record year or close to it, Oreffice said. GAF chairman Samuel Heyman estimated that the U.S. chemical industry would report a 20 pct gain in profits during 1987. Last year, the domestic industry earned a total of 13 billion dlrs, a 54 pct leap from 1985. The turn in the fortunes of the once-sickly chemical industry has been brought about by a combination of luck and planning, said Paces John Dosher. Dosher said last years fall in oil prices made feedstocks dramatically cheaper and at the same time the American dollar was weakening against foreign currencies. That helped boost U.S. chemical exports. Also helping to bring supply and demand into balance has been the gradual market absorption of the extra chemical manufacturing capacity created by Middle Eastern oil producers in the early 1980s. Finally, virtually all major U.S. chemical manufacturers have embarked on an extensive corporate restructuring program to mothball inefficient plants, trim the payroll and eliminate unrelated businesses. The restructuring touched off a flurry of friendly and hostile takeover attempts. GAF, which made an unsuccessful attempt in 1985 to acquire Union Carbide Corp UK, recently offered three billion dlrs for Borg Warner Corp BOR, a Chicago manufacturer of plastics and chemicals. Another industry powerhouse, W.R. Grace (GRA) has divested its retailing, restaurant and fertilizer businesses to raise cash for chemical acquisitions. But some experts worry that the chemical industry may be headed for trouble if companies continue turning their back on the manufacturing of staple petrochemical commodities, such as ethylene, in favor of more profitable specialty chemicals that are custom-designed for a small group of buyers. Companies like DuPont (DD) and Monsanto Co MTC spent the past two or three years trying to get out of the commodity chemical business in reaction to how badly the market had deteriorated, Dosher said. But I think they will eventually kill the margins on the profitable chemicals in the niche market. Some top chemical executives share the concern. The challenge for our industry is to keep from getting carried away and repeating past mistakes, GAFs Heyman cautioned. The shift from commodity chemicals may be ill-advised. Specialty businesses do not stay special long. Houston-based Cain Chemical, created this month by the Sterling investment banking group, believes it can generate 700 mln dlrs in annual sales by bucking the industry trend. Chairman Gordon Cain, who previously led a leveraged buyout of Duponts Conoco Incs chemical business, has spent 1.1 billion dlrs since January to buy seven petrochemical plants along the Texas Gulf Coast. The plants produce only basic commodity petrochemicals that are the building blocks of specialty products. This kind of commodity chemical business will never be a glamorous, high-margin business, Cain said, adding that demand is expected to grow by about three pct annually. Garo Armen, an analyst with Dean Witter Reynolds, said chemical makers have also benefitted by increasing demand for plastics as prices become more competitive with aluminum, wood and steel products. Armen estimated the upturn in the chemical business could last as long as four or five years, provided the U.S. economy continues its modest rate of growth.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dow_Jones_&_Company	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dow_Jones_Industrial_Average	http://dbpedia.org/resource/John_Dow_Fisher_Gilchrist	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dow_Corning	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dow_Finsterwald	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tony_Dow	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dow_AgroSciences	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dow_Medical_College	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Arthur_Wesley_Dow	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Alden_B._Dow	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Marion_Merrell_Dow	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dow_Event_Center	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mike_Dow	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dow_Constantine	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bill_Dow	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hugh_Dow	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Willie_Dow	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Charles_Dow	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Neal_Dow	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dow_Crag

Fieldcrest	3213	3223	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cannon_Mills	The largest U.S. textile maker focused on its own business as its competitors found merger partners, but now Burlington Industries Inc may have restructured itself into an attractive takeover candidate, analysts said. The takeover spotlight fell today on Burlington, which rose 4-7/8 to 52-7/8 on speculation that investor Asher Edelman and Dominion Textiles Inc of Canada bought an almost five pct stake. A published report said Edelman and Dominion jointly acquired a stake in Burlington and were weighing a takeover offer. Edelman would not comment, and a spokesman for Montreal-based Dominion called the report just rumors. Burlington said it did not know if the report was true. Wall Street professionals said they were not convinced of the story or that Edelman and Dominion would be the victors if Burlington actually came into play. Arbitragers said past comments from Dominion, however, added credence to the speculation. Dominion has said that it was looking for a takeover in the U.S. Last year, Dominion unsuccessfully bid for Avondale Mills and has maintained a 120 mln dlr line of credit to be used for a U.S. acquisition. A Dominion spokesman said Canadas largest textile producer has been negotiating with many U.S. textile companies, but would not say whether Burlington was among them. There have been acquisitions in this area. Its not unusual that someone could be looking at Burlington after the housecleaning theyve done, said Eileen Gormley of Thomson McKinnon. Burlington sold its domestic operations, which made sheets and other linens, to J.P. Stevens and Co Inc for 110 mln dlrs last year. It also has reorganized management, and focused its operations on businesses that would be less affected by foreign competition, Gormley said. Theyve pulled back so as not to be a commodity marketer, said Gormley. She said in moving more heavily into industrial fabrics, Burlington bought C.H. Masland, which supplies carpets and other fabric to the auto industry. In the past, they just spent and never realized the return on the outlays they did make, she said. You look at their record over the year, and I think theyre poised to be more profitable than they had been in the past, Gormley said. She estimated 1987 earnings of 2.50 dlrs per share, up from 2.01 dlrs per share. Some analysts today recommended clients not buy Burlington at its current levels. Edward Johnson of Johnson Redbook said he recommends selling. He said he believes the stock is worth only about 50 dlrs on a takeover basis and about 46 dlrs on an earnings basis. Some arbitragers, however, said takeover values have been placed on the company of 60 to 65 dlrs per share. After Ashers (Edelman) recent history, a lot of people dont find him very credible anymore, said one arbitrager. Another, however, said Edelman succeeds in forcing managements to take steps to enhance shareholder values even if he doesnt win the target company. Edelman was unsuccessful last year in offers for Lucky Stores Inc and Fruehauf Corp. He did succeed in buying Ponderosa Inc. The stocks of other textile makers rose along with Burlington. J.P. Stevens STN climbed 5/8 to 44-7/8, and Fieldcrest Cannon Inc FLD, the result of a merger of Fieldcrest and Cannon, rose 1-1/8 to 39-3/4. West Point-Pepperell Inc WPM rose 1-7/8 to 67-1/8.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Fieldcrest_Cannon_Classic	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Fieldcrest,_West_Virginia
Mousavi	776	783	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mir-Hossein_Mousavi	Iran decided to continue its operations east of Basra to destroy Iraqs forces, Iranian Prime Minister Mir-Hossein Mousavi told Tehran Radio. That seems to be the best spot for the complete destruction of (Iraqi President) Saddams forces. This is why it was decided that the operations would forcefully continue there, he said. At the same time, we have maintained our ability to act throughout the length of the fronts, Mousavi told the radio, monitored by the British Broadcasting Corporation. Tehran Radio reported over 1,500 Iraqi casualties today as Iran continued its Karbala-8 operation launched early yesterday. Iran said over 2,600 Iraqis had been killed or wounded yesterday. Iraq said today its forces had beaten back the latest attacks inflicting heavy casualties. Mousavi told Tehran radio that on the whole, our advances have broken the back of the military forces of Saddam. Earlier today the Iranian news agency IRNA said Tehrans forces were stabilising new positions after their assault on Iraqi lines defending Basra, Iraqs second city. In Baghdad, a military spokesman said Iraqi warplanes today destroyed an oil pumping station and a production unit at Irans Ahvaz field.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Kaveh_Mousavi	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mohammad_Mousavi_(volleyball)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ali_Mousavi	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Abdul-Karim_Mousavi_Ardebili	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mohammad_Mousavi_Khoeiniha	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Syed_Askar_Mousavi	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Alireza_Mousavi	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Iman_Mousavi	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mir-Hossein_Mousavi_presidential_campaign,_2009	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Seyed_Mohsen_Mousavi	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hossein_Mousavi_Tabrizi	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Kazem_Mousavi-Bojnourdi	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Abdolvahed_Mousavi_Lari	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Abdolrahim_Mousavi	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ahmad_Mousavi	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Taraneh_Mousavi	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Fakhraddin_Mousavi	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Jamaluddin_Mousavi	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Farid_Mousavi	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ayoub_Mousavi
Tenn	1170	1174	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tennessee	Promising new findings in the use of a controversial experimental drug called Interleukin-2 as a cure for cancer will be published in the April 9 issue of the prestigious New England Journal of Medicine, according to a Wall Street analyst who has obtained an advance copy of the magazine. Among interleukins principal U. S. makers are Cetus Corp CTUS, headquartered in Emeryville, Calif., and Immunex Corp IMNX, based in Seattle, Wash. The journal, to be released late today, contains two articles reporting high remission rates several cancer types. The journal also contains a signed editorial concluding that the new results mark a significant milestone in the search for a successful immunotherapy for cancer. Interleukin-2, also known as IL-2, is a substance naturally produced by living cells in the laboratory. The drug is controversial because it was widely praised as a promising cancer treatment in early reports on its effectiveness in late 1985, only to come under criticism a year later for its failure to live up to its promise and due to its ravaging side effects. One of the new studies, conducted by Dr. William West of Biotherapeutics Inc of Franklin, Tenn., is particularly significant because it found far fewer harsh side effects after it changed the way in which the drug is administered. In that study, researchers administered IL-2 to 48 cancer patients and found a 50-pct remission rate for kidney cancers and a 50 pct remission rate for melanoma, a type of skin cancer, according to Prudential-Bache Securities Stuart Weisbrod, who obtained the advance copy of the magazine. For rectal and colon cancer, the researchers found no remissions, but none of the 48 patients treated had side effects serious enough to be placed under intensive hospital care, according to the article. In the second study, whose principal author is Dr. Steven Rosenberg of the National Cancer Institute, researchers administered IL-2 to 157 cancer patients and found a 33 pct remission rate in cancers of the kidney, a 27 pct rate in melanomas and a 15 pct rate in cancers of the colon and rectum. In the National Cancer Institute trials, a total of four patients died, the magazine reported, confirming the harshness of the drugs side effects as originally administered. Perhaps we are at the end of the beginning of the search for successful immunotherapy for cancer, said the editorial, signed by John Durant of Philadelphias Chase Cancer Center. These observations reported by Rosenberg and West surely did not describe successful practical approaches ready for widespread applications in the therapy of cancer patients, the editorial said. On the other hand, if they reflect, as seems possible, a successful manipulation of the cellular immune system, then we may be near the end of our search for a meaningful direction in the immunuotherapy of cancer, the editorial concluded.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ten_Out_of_Tenn	http://dbpedia.org/resource/William_Tenn	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Alcoa_Tenn_Federal_Credit_Union	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Arthur_Tenn	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hoher_Tenn
IMF	852	855	http://dbpedia.org/resource/International_Monetary_Fund	The Zambian government has no immediate plans to follow last weeks increase in the producer price of maize with a hike in the retail price of maize meal, an official of the ruling party said. Last December, a 120 pct increase in the consumer price for refined maize meal, a Zambian staple, led to food riots in which at least 15 people died. That price increase, which President Kenneth Kaunda later revoked, followed pressure by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to reduce the governments subsidy bill. However, if the producer price rise, from 6.10 dlrs to 8.67 dlrs per 90-kg bag, is not accompanied by a retail price increase, the government will have to spend more on subsidies, a practice discouraged by the IMF. There is no way out but to raise the subsidy levels of meal. It (the government) would have to choose between the demands of the IMF and those of the people, a Ministry of Agriculture economist said.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/IMF_Stand-By_Arrangement	http://dbpedia.org/resource/IMF_Economic_Review	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ukraine–IMF_relations	http://dbpedia.org/resource/List_of_IMF_ranked_countries_by_GDP	http://dbpedia.org/resource/List_of_IMF_Economic_Counsellors	http://dbpedia.org/resource/IMF_(file_format)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/1976_IMF_Crisis	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Romania-IMF_relations	http://dbpedia.org/resource/IMF_Balance_of_Payments_Manual
Reagan	958	964	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ronald_Reagan	Senior Japanese officials tomorrow open talks with American trade negotiators in a last-ditch effort to avert new high U.S. tariffs to be imposed on a wide variety of Japanese electronic exports. Makoto Kuroda, vice minister of Japans Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI), is to hold two days of meetings with the Deputy U.S. Trade Representative, Michael Smith, and the Under Secretary of Commerce, Bruce Smart. The new tariffs, to go into effect on April 17, are in retaliation for Japans failure to adhere to an agreement to end dumping semiconductors in world markets at below cost and to open its home market to U.S. semiconductor shipments. They are to be imposed on goods which use semiconductors, including television and audio equipment and computers. Both U.S. and Japanese officials have said there was little likelihood the talks would do anything to avert the 100 pct duties on 300 mln dlrs worth of Japanese shipments. President Reagan announced the planned tariffs on March 27 after he said that close monitoring of the July 1986 U.S.-Japanese semiconductor pact convinced U.S. officials that Japan was not honoring the agreement. In making the annoucement, Reagan said I am committed to the full enforcement of our trade agreements designed to provide American industry with free and fair trade. Trade analysts said his move was aimed as much at Japans semiconductor trade practices, which are said to have injured the U.S. semiconductor industry, as Congress, which has complained about presidential timidity on trade issues. Congressional Democrats have pledged to enact aggressive trade laws to counter what they contend has been Reagans inaction to redress the growing U.S. trade deficit, which last year reached 169.8 billion dlrs. About one-third of the deficit was with Japan. Reagan said there were recent signs Japan was beginning to adhere to the pact and that was why he was not terminating it. Kuroda said on leaving Tokyo today he had no new proposals but did have an explanation of the semiconductor situation. He told the daily newspaper Ashai Shimbun that Reagans decision was based on inaccurate data and an exaggerated sense of MITIs power to control Japanese traders. The United States has excessive expectations., he said. To stabilize supply-demand relations which have been disrupted by excess inventories since 1985 will take some time. He also said that U.S. firms had not been aggressive enough in trying to sell in the Japanese market.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Nancy_Reagan	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Presidency_of_Ronald_Reagan	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ronald_Reagan_Washington_National_Airport	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Reagan_Youth	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ronald_Reagan_Presidential_Library	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ronald_Reagan_UCLA_Medical_Center	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Michael_Reagan	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ron_Reagan	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Reagan_Doctrine	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Attempted_assassination_of_Ronald_Reagan	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Reagan_County,_Texas	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Maureen_Reagan	http://dbpedia.org/resource/List_of_federal_judges_appointed_by_Ronald_Reagan	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ronald_Reagan_in_music	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Reagan_Pasternak	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ronald_Reagan_filmography	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ronald_Reagan_Ballistic_Missile_Defense_Test_Site	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ronald_Reagan_Cross_County_Highway	http://dbpedia.org/resource/The_Reagans	http://dbpedia.org/resource/USS_Ronald_Reagan

Morgan	2432	2438	http://dbpedia.org/resource/J._P._Morgan	J.P. Morgan and Co Inc said its first-quarter earnings fell by 3.2 pct, largely reflecting its previously announced decision to place on non-accrual status its 1.3 billion dlrs of medium- and long-term loans to Brazil. That decision, spurred by Brazils suspension of interest payments on February 20, reduced the quarters net income by 20 mln dlrs to 226.4 mln dlrs, compared with 233.9 mln in the first three months of 1986. Morgan also reported a loss of 1.8 mln dlrs from securities underwriting and trading, in contrast to a gain of 45.4 mln dlrs in the year-earlier period. In the fourth quarter of 1986, Morgan posted other trading losses of 5.5 mln dlrs because of setbacks in the trading and underwriting of Euromarket securities. Conditions in some sectors of the Euromarket remained difficult last quarter, with floating rate notes suffering heavy price falls, but a spokeswoman was unable to say whether Morgans trading losses were restricted to the Euromarket. On the positive side, Morgan reduced its provision for loan losses to 35 mln dlrs from 70 mln a year earlier. Foreign exchange trading income rose to 82 mln dlrs from 72.6 mln and trust income increased to 95.9 mln dlrs from 75.9 mln. Morgan said other operating income, mainly fees and commissions, rose to 102.2 mln dlrs from 88.4 mln, but net investment securities gains dropped to 43.1 mln from 58.1 mln. Net interest earnings were 490.4 mln dlrs in the first quarter, down from 499.4 mln a year earlier, and net yield fell to 2.79 pct from 3.20 pct. If Brazil had not been placed on non-accrual, which means that interest can be recorded as income only when payments are actually received, net interest earnings would have been 525.9 mln dlrs and net yield 2.99 pct. If Brazil does not resume payments, 1987 net would be cut by 72 mln dlrs, Morgan added.

Boeing	738	744	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Boeing	Faulty repair work by The Boeing Company BA.N was a contributary cause to a Japan Air Lines Co Ltd JAPN.Y 747 crash on August 12, 1985, that killed 520 people, the final draft of a Ministry of Transport report says. There were only four survivors when the aircraft crashed into a mountain north of Tokyo. The report said inadequate inspection of the aircraft by Japanese inspectors after the repairs was another factor in the crash. The crew were cleared of any responsibility for the disaster. The report, which was sent on March 23 to the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board for comment, should be released in late May. Under an international convention the draft must be submitted for final comments to the relevant authorities. Boeing spokesmen were unavailable for comment. On April 4, a Boeing spokesman at the firms headquarters said the company would probably make no comment on the Japanese investigation teams report until it was officially released. On September 6, 1985, Boeing said in a statement that the 1978 repairs it had undertaken were faulty. This statement did not, however, connect the faulty repairs with the cause of the crash.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Boeing_737	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Boeing_727	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Boeing_747	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Boeing_707	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Boeing_757	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Boeing_767	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Boeing_777	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Boeing_737_Classic	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Boeing_B-17_Flying_Fortress	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Boeing_B-29_Superfortress	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Boeing_747-400	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Boeing_737_Next_Generation	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Boeing_B-52_Stratofortress	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Boeing_CH-47_Chinook	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Boeing_787_Dreamliner	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Boeing_KC-135_Stratotanker	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Boeing_Field	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Boeing_717	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Boeing_720	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Boeing_B-47_Stratojet
Borg Warner Corp	3047	3063	http://dbpedia.org/resource/BorgWarner	Cheap oil feedstocks, the weakened U.S. dollar and a plant utilization rate approaching 90 pct will propel the streamlined U.S. petrochemical industry to record profits this year, with growth expected through at least 1990, major company executives predicted. This bullish outlook for chemical manufacturing and an industrywide move to shed unrelated businesses has prompted GAF Corp (GAF), privately-held Cain Chemical Inc, and other firms to aggressively seek acquisitions of petrochemical plants. Oil companies such as Ashland Oil Inc (ASH), the Kentucky-based oil refiner and marketer, are also shopping for money-making petrochemical businesses to buy. I see us poised at the threshold of a golden period, said Paul Oreffice, chairman of giant Dow Chemical Co (DOW), adding, Theres no major plant capacity being added around the world now. The whole game is bringing out new products and improving the old ones. Analysts say the chemical industrys biggest customers, automobile manufacturers and home builders that use a lot of paints and plastics, are expected to buy quantities this year. U.S. petrochemical plants are currently operating at about 90 pct capacity, reflecting tighter supply that could hike product prices by 30 to 40 pct this year, said John Dosher, managing director of Pace Consultants Inc of Houston. Demand for some products such as styrene could push profit margins up by as much as 300 pct, he said. Oreffice, speaking at a meeting of chemical engineers in Houston, said Dow would easily top the 741 mln dlrs it earned last year and predicted it would have the best year in its history. In 1985, when oil prices were still above 25 dlrs a barrel and chemical exports were adversely affected by the strong U.S. dollar, Dow had profits of 58 mln dlrs. I believe the entire chemical industry is headed for a record year or close to it, Oreffice said. GAF chairman Samuel Heyman estimated that the U.S. chemical industry would report a 20 pct gain in profits during 1987. Last year, the domestic industry earned a total of 13 billion dlrs, a 54 pct leap from 1985. The turn in the fortunes of the once-sickly chemical industry has been brought about by a combination of luck and planning, said Paces John Dosher. Dosher said last years fall in oil prices made feedstocks dramatically cheaper and at the same time the American dollar was weakening against foreign currencies. That helped boost U.S. chemical exports. Also helping to bring supply and demand into balance has been the gradual market absorption of the extra chemical manufacturing capacity created by Middle Eastern oil producers in the early 1980s. Finally, virtually all major U.S. chemical manufacturers have embarked on an extensive corporate restructuring program to mothball inefficient plants, trim the payroll and eliminate unrelated businesses. The restructuring touched off a flurry of friendly and hostile takeover attempts. GAF, which made an unsuccessful attempt in 1985 to acquire Union Carbide Corp UK, recently offered three billion dlrs for Borg Warner Corp BOR, a Chicago manufacturer of plastics and chemicals. Another industry powerhouse, W.R. Grace (GRA) has divested its retailing, restaurant and fertilizer businesses to raise cash for chemical acquisitions. But some experts worry that the chemical industry may be headed for trouble if companies continue turning their back on the manufacturing of staple petrochemical commodities, such as ethylene, in favor of more profitable specialty chemicals that are custom-designed for a small group of buyers. Companies like DuPont (DD) and Monsanto Co MTC spent the past two or three years trying to get out of the commodity chemical business in reaction to how badly the market had deteriorated, Dosher said. But I think they will eventually kill the margins on the profitable chemicals in the niche market. Some top chemical executives share the concern. The challenge for our industry is to keep from getting carried away and repeating past mistakes, GAFs Heyman cautioned. The shift from commodity chemicals may be ill-advised. Specialty businesses do not stay special long. Houston-based Cain Chemical, created this month by the Sterling investment banking group, believes it can generate 700 mln dlrs in annual sales by bucking the industry trend. Chairman Gordon Cain, who previously led a leveraged buyout of Duponts Conoco Incs chemical business, has spent 1.1 billion dlrs since January to buy seven petrochemical plants along the Texas Gulf Coast. The plants produce only basic commodity petrochemicals that are the building blocks of specialty products. This kind of commodity chemical business will never be a glamorous, high-margin business, Cain said, adding that demand is expected to grow by about three pct annually. Garo Armen, an analyst with Dean Witter Reynolds, said chemical makers have also benefitted by increasing demand for plastics as prices become more competitive with aluminum, wood and steel products. Armen estimated the upturn in the chemical business could last as long as four or five years, provided the U.S. economy continues its modest rate of growth.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Isle_of_Man_Civil_Defence_Corps	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pacific_Bearing_Corp	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Waterloo_Historic_District_(Warner,_New_Hampshire)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/French_ship_Six_Corps_(1762)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/X_Corps_(United_Kingdom)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Spy_Corps	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Empress_Casino_Joliet_Corp._v._Giannoulias	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Marine_Corps_Planning_Process	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Math_Science_Teaching_Corps	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Veda_Ann_Borg	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Entergy_Corp._v._Riverkeeper_Inc.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/XIX_Corps	http://dbpedia.org/resource/United_States_Navy_Dental_Corps	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Kalmykian_Voluntary_Cavalry_Corps	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Delta_Corp_Limited	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cardston-Taber-Warner	http://dbpedia.org/resource/National_Security_Corps	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ottendorf's_Corps	http://dbpedia.org/resource/John_Warner_(bishop)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Frontier_Corps

Reagan	1188	1194	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ronald_Reagan	Senior Japanese officials tomorrow open talks with American trade negotiators in a last-ditch effort to avert new high U.S. tariffs to be imposed on a wide variety of Japanese electronic exports. Makoto Kuroda, vice minister of Japans Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI), is to hold two days of meetings with the Deputy U.S. Trade Representative, Michael Smith, and the Under Secretary of Commerce, Bruce Smart. The new tariffs, to go into effect on April 17, are in retaliation for Japans failure to adhere to an agreement to end dumping semiconductors in world markets at below cost and to open its home market to U.S. semiconductor shipments. They are to be imposed on goods which use semiconductors, including television and audio equipment and computers. Both U.S. and Japanese officials have said there was little likelihood the talks would do anything to avert the 100 pct duties on 300 mln dlrs worth of Japanese shipments. President Reagan announced the planned tariffs on March 27 after he said that close monitoring of the July 1986 U.S.-Japanese semiconductor pact convinced U.S. officials that Japan was not honoring the agreement. In making the annoucement, Reagan said I am committed to the full enforcement of our trade agreements designed to provide American industry with free and fair trade. Trade analysts said his move was aimed as much at Japans semiconductor trade practices, which are said to have injured the U.S. semiconductor industry, as Congress, which has complained about presidential timidity on trade issues. Congressional Democrats have pledged to enact aggressive trade laws to counter what they contend has been Reagans inaction to redress the growing U.S. trade deficit, which last year reached 169.8 billion dlrs. About one-third of the deficit was with Japan. Reagan said there were recent signs Japan was beginning to adhere to the pact and that was why he was not terminating it. Kuroda said on leaving Tokyo today he had no new proposals but did have an explanation of the semiconductor situation. He told the daily newspaper Ashai Shimbun that Reagans decision was based on inaccurate data and an exaggerated sense of MITIs power to control Japanese traders. The United States has excessive expectations., he said. To stabilize supply-demand relations which have been disrupted by excess inventories since 1985 will take some time. He also said that U.S. firms had not been aggressive enough in trying to sell in the Japanese market.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Nancy_Reagan	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Presidency_of_Ronald_Reagan	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ronald_Reagan_Washington_National_Airport	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Reagan_Youth	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ronald_Reagan_Presidential_Library	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ronald_Reagan_UCLA_Medical_Center	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Michael_Reagan	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ron_Reagan	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Reagan_Doctrine	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Attempted_assassination_of_Ronald_Reagan	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Reagan_County,_Texas	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Maureen_Reagan	http://dbpedia.org/resource/List_of_federal_judges_appointed_by_Ronald_Reagan	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ronald_Reagan_in_music	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Reagan_Pasternak	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ronald_Reagan_filmography	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ronald_Reagan_Ballistic_Missile_Defense_Test_Site	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ronald_Reagan_Cross_County_Highway	http://dbpedia.org/resource/The_Reagans	http://dbpedia.org/resource/USS_Ronald_Reagan

Finance Ministry	477	493	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ministry_of_Finance_(Japan)	Britain intends to negotiate further agreements on international securities regulation to match those now in force with the U.S. And Japan, government sources said. The Department of Trade and Industry said earlier it had concluded a memorandum of understanding with Japans Finance Ministry to swap supervisory and investigatory information. The agreement covers stocks, shares and government bonds, but not commodity futures, whose regulation in Japan does not come under the Finance Ministry. It therefore does not cover some transactions on the London International Financial Futures Exchange and the London commodities and metal exchanges. The DTI said it hoped to seek further understandings with other countries which met in the U.K. Last December. The meeting involved delegates from the U.K., Switzerland, the U.S., Canada, Australia, Hong Kong, Japan, France, West Germany and Holland. Government sources said the deal with Japan completes arrangements linking Tokyo, the U.S. And London. A U.K. Agreement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) was signed last September. Todays agreement will deal with requests for information on a case by case basis, U.K. Government sources said.

Agriculture Ministry	108	128	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ministry_of_Agriculture_(Brazil)	Storage problems with Brazils record grain crop are likely to result in losses of about five mln tonnes, an Agriculture Ministry spokesman said. Ministry spokesman Leonardo Brito, speaking from Brasilia, told Reuters he believed that about five mln tonnes of this years estimated crop of 65 mln tonnes would be lost. He said part of this would be the normal loss inevitable in harvesting, but that most of it would stem from storage problems. Brazil has a storage capacity of 66 mln tonnes, theoretically sufficient for the crop. But Brito said that the storage capacity was badly distributed. The states of Sao Paulo, Parana and Rio Grande do Sul had between them 70 pct of the nations capacity, but were responsible for only 50 to 60 pct of production. The biggest problems are concentrated in the Centre-West growing regions, where rising production has outpaced storage capacity. Brito said the Centre-West, whose crops include soya and maize, had between 30 and 40 pct of the nations grains production but only 20 pct of its storage space. In addition to the poor distribution of storage units, there is the problem that too much of the capacity is geared to storing grain in sacks, while not enough is suitable for storing loose grain, Brito said. Finally, there is a shortage of lorries to transport the crops. The sheer scale of the task in transporting the record crop has been evident from television reports, which have shown enormous queues of lorries waiting outside granaries.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Agriculture	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ministry_of_Railways_(Pakistan)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/United_States_Department_of_Agriculture	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ministry_of_Defence_(United_Kingdom)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ministry_of_Transport_(Brazil)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Air_Ministry	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ministry_(government_department)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ministry_of_Railways_(India)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ministry_of_Sound	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ministry_of_Transportation_of_Ontario	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ministry_of_War_Transport	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Food_and_Agriculture_Organization	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sustainable_agriculture	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Subsistence_agriculture	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ministry_of_Justice	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ministry_(band)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ministry_of_Supply	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Christian_ministry	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ministry_of_Jesus	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ministry_of_Home_Affairs_(India)

Agrimont SPA, the holding company for Montedisons Agro-Industrial businesses, had sales of 810 billion lire and a net profit of about 1.1 billion lire, after amortization costs of 35 billion lire and a 13 billion lire reduction in the value of inventory due to falling market prices, Montedison said. Agrimont, still wholly owned by Montedison, is taking steps to be traded on the Milan exchange, the company said. The company said that 1986 was characterized by an unstable fertlizer market due to the weak dollar and the decline of international prices for products sold in Europe and the U.S where Agrimont operates through its Conserv division. In pesticides and in animal health care products Agrimont maintained its previous level of revenues and market share in 1986, Montedison said.

Agrimont, still wholly owned by Montedison, is taking steps to be traded on the Milan exchange, the company said. The company said that 1986 was characterized by an unstable fertlizer market due to the weak dollar and the decline of international prices for products sold in Europe and the U.S where Agrimont operates through its Conserv division. In pesticides and in animal health care products Agrimont maintained its previous level of revenues and market share in 1986, Montedison said. Montedison said it named Ettore dellIsola to the newly created position of president of Agrimont. Montedison also said it named Renato Picco, managing director of Eridania SPA and Gianfranco Ceroni, managing director of Italiana Olii e Sifi, both of whom are members of the the Ferruzzi Groups management board, to Argimonts board of directors. Ferruzzi owns about 40 pct of Montedison, the company said.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/A.C._Milan	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Inter_Milan	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Province_of_Milan	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Milan_Metro	http://dbpedia.org/resource/University_of_Milan	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Duchy_of_Milan	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Milan_Conservatory	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Milan_Kundera	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Milan_Cathedral	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Milan–San_Remo	http://dbpedia.org/resource/MILAN	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Milan_Records	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Milan,_Ohio	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Milan,_Tennessee	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Milan_Fashion_Week	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Milan_Šrejber	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Metropolitan_City_of_Milan	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Piccolo_Teatro_(Milan)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Milan_Vidmar	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Milan,_Michigan

Office of Management and Budget	0	31	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Office_of_Management_and_Budget	Office of Management and Budget Director James Miller said President Reagan will reject the tax increase called for in the House Budget Committees 1988 budget proposal which is before the House for a vote today. Its just completely unacceptable, Miller told a House Appropriations subcommittee on Treasury, Postal Service and General Government Appropriations. The plan, drafted by the Democratic-controlled Budget committee, calls for 22 billion dlrs in higher revenues, of which 18 billion would be from new taxes set by the tax-writing committees. The House committees budget proposal includes some increases in federal user fees as well as 18 billion dlrs in taxes. Miller warned that failure to reduce the federal deficit would jeopardize the U.S. economy. If we do not further reduce the deficit... we place this economic expansion that weve had in the last five years at risk, Miller told the subcommittee. The result of any kind of tax increase would be to increase substantially the prospects that the expansion would come to an end, Miller said.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Provinces_of_Iran	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Counties_of_Iran	http://dbpedia.org/resource/National_Register_of_Historic_Places	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Departments_of_France	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Communes_of_France	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Voivodeships_of_Poland	http://dbpedia.org/resource/List_of_sovereign_states	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Political_divisions_of_the_United_States	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Administrative_divisions_of_Azerbaijan	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Republic_of_Ireland	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Provinces_of_Turkey	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bosnia_and_Herzegovina	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Regions_of_France	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bachelor_of_Arts	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Municipalities_of_Slovenia	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Track_and_field	http://dbpedia.org/resource/States_of_Brazil	http://dbpedia.org/resource/University_of_Michigan	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Statistical_regions_of_Slovenia	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Provinces_of_Spain
Dominion	1007	1015	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dominion_Textile	The largest U.S. textile maker focused on its own business as its competitors found merger partners, but now Burlington Industries Inc may have restructured itself into an attractive takeover candidate, analysts said. The takeover spotlight fell today on Burlington, which rose 4-7/8 to 52-7/8 on speculation that investor Asher Edelman and Dominion Textiles Inc of Canada bought an almost five pct stake. A published report said Edelman and Dominion jointly acquired a stake in Burlington and were weighing a takeover offer. Edelman would not comment, and a spokesman for Montreal-based Dominion called the report just rumors. Burlington said it did not know if the report was true. Wall Street professionals said they were not convinced of the story or that Edelman and Dominion would be the victors if Burlington actually came into play. Arbitragers said past comments from Dominion, however, added credence to the speculation. Dominion has said that it was looking for a takeover in the U.S. Last year, Dominion unsuccessfully bid for Avondale Mills and has maintained a 120 mln dlr line of credit to be used for a U.S. acquisition. A Dominion spokesman said Canadas largest textile producer has been negotiating with many U.S. textile companies, but would not say whether Burlington was among them. There have been acquisitions in this area. Its not unusual that someone could be looking at Burlington after the housecleaning theyve done, said Eileen Gormley of Thomson McKinnon. Burlington sold its domestic operations, which made sheets and other linens, to J.P. Stevens and Co Inc for 110 mln dlrs last year. It also has reorganized management, and focused its operations on businesses that would be less affected by foreign competition, Gormley said. Theyve pulled back so as not to be a commodity marketer, said Gormley. She said in moving more heavily into industrial fabrics, Burlington bought C.H. Masland, which supplies carpets and other fabric to the auto industry. In the past, they just spent and never realized the return on the outlays they did make, she said. You look at their record over the year, and I think theyre poised to be more profitable than they had been in the past, Gormley said. She estimated 1987 earnings of 2.50 dlrs per share, up from 2.01 dlrs per share. Some analysts today recommended clients not buy Burlington at its current levels. Edward Johnson of Johnson Redbook said he recommends selling. He said he believes the stock is worth only about 50 dlrs on a takeover basis and about 46 dlrs on an earnings basis. Some arbitragers, however, said takeover values have been placed on the company of 60 to 65 dlrs per share. After Ashers (Edelman) recent history, a lot of people dont find him very credible anymore, said one arbitrager. Another, however, said Edelman succeeds in forcing managements to take steps to enhance shareholder values even if he doesnt win the target company. Edelman was unsuccessful last year in offers for Lucky Stores Inc and Fruehauf Corp. He did succeed in buying Ponderosa Inc. The stocks of other textile makers rose along with Burlington. J.P. Stevens STN climbed 5/8 to 44-7/8, and Fieldcrest Cannon Inc FLD, the result of a merger of Fieldcrest and Cannon, rose 1-1/8 to 39-3/4. West Point-Pepperell Inc WPM rose 1-7/8 to 67-1/8.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dominion	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dominion_of_Newfoundland	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Old_Dominion_University	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Kings_Dominion	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dominion_of_Ceylon	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dominion_of_Pakistan	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dominion_of_India	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dominion_Lands_Act	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Toronto-Dominion_Bank	http://dbpedia.org/resource/The_Dominion_Post_(Wellington)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dominion_Range	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dominion_Land_Survey	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dominion_Resources	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dominion_Theatre	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dominion_Atlantic_Railway	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Inter_Dominion	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dominion_Enterprises	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dominion_(Star_Trek)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dominion_Astrophysical_Observatory	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dominion_of_New_England
Iraq	685	689	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Iraq	Iran decided to continue its operations east of Basra to destroy Iraqs forces, Iranian Prime Minister Mir-Hossein Mousavi told Tehran Radio. That seems to be the best spot for the complete destruction of (Iraqi President) Saddams forces. This is why it was decided that the operations would forcefully continue there, he said. At the same time, we have maintained our ability to act throughout the length of the fronts, Mousavi told the radio, monitored by the British Broadcasting Corporation. Tehran Radio reported over 1,500 Iraqi casualties today as Iran continued its Karbala-8 operation launched early yesterday. Iran said over 2,600 Iraqis had been killed or wounded yesterday. Iraq said today its forces had beaten back the latest attacks inflicting heavy casualties. Mousavi told Tehran radio that on the whole, our advances have broken the back of the military forces of Saddam. Earlier today the Iranian news agency IRNA said Tehrans forces were stabilising new positions after their assault on Iraqi lines defending Basra, Iraqs second city. In Baghdad, a military spokesman said Iraqi warplanes today destroyed an oil pumping station and a production unit at Irans Ahvaz field.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Iraq_War	http://dbpedia.org/resource/2003_invasion_of_Iraq	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Iran–Iraq_War	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Islamic_State_of_Iraq_and_the_Levant	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Iraq_national_football_team	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Governorates_of_Iraq	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Districts_of_Iraq	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ba'athist_Iraq	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Kingdom_of_Iraq	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Council_of_Representatives_of_Iraq	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Iraq_Campaign_Medal	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Prime_Minister_of_Iraq	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Balad,_Iraq	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Islamic_State_of_Iraq	http://dbpedia.org/resource/President_of_Iraq	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Faisal_I_of_Iraq	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Constitution_of_Iraq	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Multi-National_Force_–_Iraq	http://dbpedia.org/resource/National_Assembly_of_Iraq	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Iraq_Football_Association
Entre Rios	712	722	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Entre_Ríos_Province	Argentine grain producers adjusted their yield estimates for the 1986/87 coarse grain crop downward in the week to yesterday after the heavy rains at the end of March and beginning of April, trade sources said. They said sunflower, maize and sorghum production estimates had been reduced despite some later warm, dry weather, which has allowed a return to harvesting in some areas. However, as showers fell intermittently after last weekend, producers feared another spell of prolonged and intense rain could cause more damage to crops already badly hit this season. Rains in the middle of last week reached an average of 27 millimetres in parts of Buenos Aires province, 83 mm in Cordoba, 41 in Santa Fe, 50 in Entre Rios and Misiones, 95 in Corrientes, eight in Chaco and 35 in Formosa. There was no rainfall in the same period in La Pampa. Producers feared continued damp conditions could produce rotting and lead to still lower yield estimates for all the crops, including soybean. However, as the lands began drying later in the week harvesting advanced considerably, reaching between 36 and 40 pct of the area sown in the case of sunflower. Deterioration of the sunflower crop evident in harvested material in Cordoba, La Pampa and Buenos Aires forced yield estimates per hectare to be adjusted down again. The seasons sunflowerseed production is now forecast at 2.1 mln to 2.3 mln tonnes, against 2.2 mln to 2.4 mln forecast last week and down 43.9 to 48.8 pct on the 1985/86 record of 4.1 mln. Area sown to sunflowers was two to 2.2 mln hectares, 29.9 to 36.3 pct below the record 3.14 mln hectares last season. Maize harvesting has also reached 36 to 40 pct of the area sown. It is near completion in Cordoba and Santa Fe and will begin in La Pampa and southern Buenos Aires later in April. Production estimates for maize were down from last week at 9.5 mln to 9.8 mln tonnes, against 9.6 mln to 9.9 mln estimated previously. This is 22.2 to 23.4 pct below the 12.4 mln to 12.6 mln tonnes estimated by private sources for the 1985/86 crop and 21.9 to 25.8 pct down on the official figure of 12.8 mln tonnes. Maize was sown on 3.58 mln to 3.78 mln hectares, two to seven pct down on last seasons 3.85 mln. Sorghum was harvested on 23 to 25 pct of the area sown in Cordoba, Santa Fe and Chaco. Harvest will start in La Pampa and Buenos Aires in mid-April. The total area sown was 1.23 mln to 1.30 mln hectares, 10.3 to 15.2 pct down on the 1.45 mln sown last season. The new forecast for the sorghum crop is 2.9 mln to 3.2 mln tonnes compared with three mln to 3.3 mln forecast last week, and is 23.8 to 29.3 pct down on last seasons 4.1 mln to 4.2 mln tonne crop. The soybean crop for this season was not adjusted, remaining at a record 7.5 mln to 7.7 mln tonnes, up 4.2 to 5.5 pct on the 7.2 mln to 7.3 mln estimated by private sources for 1985/86 and 5.6 to 8.5 pct higher than the official figure of 7.1 mln. The area sown to soybeans this season was a record 3.7 mln to 3.8 mln hectares, 10.8 to 13.8 pct up on the record 3.34 mln sown in 1985/86. The soybean crop is showing excessive moisture in some areas and producers fear they may discover more damage. Some experimental harvesting was carried out in Santa Fe on areas making up only about one pct of the total crop but details on this were not available. Preparation of the fields for the 1987/88 wheat crop, which will be sown between May and August or September, has so far not been as intense as in previous years.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Paraná,_Entre_Ríos	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Gualeguaychú,_Entre_Ríos	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Concordia,_Entre_Ríos	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Gualeguay,_Entre_Ríos	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Colón,_Entre_Ríos	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Victoria,_Entre_Ríos	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Entre_caníbales	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Diamante,_Entre_Ríos	http://dbpedia.org/resource/La_Paz,_Entre_Ríos	http://dbpedia.org/resource/San_Salvador,_Entre_Ríos	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Entre_Ríos_Railway	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Crespo,_Entre_Ríos	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Villa_Elisa,_Entre_Ríos	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Entre-Douro-e-Minho_Province	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Entre_Douro_e_Vouga	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Federación,_Entre_Ríos	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Larroque,_Entre_Ríos	http://dbpedia.org/resource/El_tiempo_entre_costuras	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Federal,_Entre_Ríos	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Entre-Deux-Mers

Dominion Textile Inc	0	20	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dominion_Textile	Dominion Textile Inc considers a published report that it has bought a stake in Burlington Industries Inc and is considering making a joint bid for the company to be a rumor, a company spokesman said. As far as I am concerned and the company is concerned, they are rumors and were not commenting on rumors, spokesman Michel Dufour told Reuters in response to a query. All the information that has been given out publicly is that, yes, Dominion Textile is interested in making an acquisition that big...probably based on that people are starting all sorts of rumors, he said. Dufour said yes when asked whether the report was only a rumor, but said the company was not prepared to comment further. Dominion Textile president and chairman Thomas Bell was out of town and unavailable for comment. Dominion Textile last year made an unsuccesful 104-mln- U.S.-dlr bid for Avondale Mills and has maintained a 120-mln- U.S.-dlr line of credit to be used for an American acquisition. Dufour said the company has been negotiating with many U.S. textile companies but would not say whether Burlington Industries was one of them. Burlingtons stock rose sharply this morning on the report, which said Dominion Textile had joined with U.S. investor Asher Edelman to buy a stake in the company and to consider making a takeover offer. Dominion Textile, which reported operating profit of 11.1 mln Canadian dlrs last year on sales of 926.5 mln dlrs, has repeatedly said it will concentrate on expanding into the U.S. The company has said it plans to diversify into new product and market areas in addition to expanding its textile operations.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Textile	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dominion	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dominion_of_Newfoundland	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Textile_manufacturing	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Old_Dominion_University	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Textile_industry	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Spinning_(textiles)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Spindle_(textiles)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Kings_Dominion	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dominion_of_Ceylon	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dominion_of_Pakistan	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Textile_Bowl	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dominion_of_India	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Textile_arts	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dominion_Lands_Act	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Toronto-Dominion_Bank	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Textile_printing	http://dbpedia.org/resource/The_Dominion_Post_(Wellington)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Stitch_(textile_arts)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dominion_Range

Senate	435	441	http://dbpedia.org/resource/United_States_Senate	The U.S. Senate Budget Committee ended its stalemate over a budget plan and approved by a single vote a revised 1988 budget proposed by chairman Lawton Chiles to cut the deficit to 133.7 billion next year. The new plan broke last week to cut the deficit to 133.7 billion next year. The new plan broke last week's gridlock in which the committee failed to approve a similar Chiles plan on a tie vote. Today, the measure was sent to the Senate 13 to 11. Among a series of changes to get the extra vote, Chiles added about 400 mln dlrs for additional, unspecified, agricultural spending programs to be paid with partly with higher user fees.

Quebec	0	6	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Quebec	Quebec mines minister Raymond Savoie said the province is prepared to offer money to help re-open (Noranda Inc))'s Murdochville, Quebec copper mine, shut down by fire last week, but said he could not give a specific figure until damage estimates have been completed. Federal member of parliament for the region,  Charles-Eugene Marin, said last week the federal government is also prepared to provide financial help to restart operations as soon as possible. Noranda has estimated damage from the fire at about 10 mln dlrs and a company spokesman said it should have a more specific estimate by the end of the month. Noranda said it had hoped to have an estimate sooner, but has found that it will take longer than expected to gain access to the burned-out area. Noranda said the mine was not insured.  said the mine was not insured. "We decided many years ago...that the costs of insuring all of NorandaNoranda's underground operations would have been prohibitive, underground operations would have been prohibitive," Larry Taylor, NorandaNoranda's risk management and insurance director, said. Taylor said before last week said before last week's fire, the company had only had one previous mine accident many years ago. Last weeks fire, the company had only had one previous mine accident many years ago. Last week's fire killed one miner and trapped 52 other underground, some for up to 24 hours. It was believed to have started on a new conveyor system. Noranda has said it would take four to five months to return the mine to normal operating capacity. It produced 72,0000 tons of copper anode last year, Coffin said.

J.P. Stevens and Co Inc 	1565	1589	http://dbpedia.org/resource/WestPoint_Home	The largest U.S. textile maker focused on its own business as its competitors found merger partners, but now Burlington Industries Inc may have restructured itself into an attractive takeover candidate, analysts said. The takeover spotlight fell today on Burlington, which rose 4-7/8 to 52-7/8 on speculation that investor Asher Edelman and Dominion Textiles Inc of Canada bought an almost five pct stake. A published report said Edelman and Dominion jointly acquired a stake in Burlington and were weighing a takeover offer. Edelman would not comment, and a spokesman for Montreal-based Dominion called the report just rumors. Burlington said it did not know if the report was true. Wall Street professionals said they were not convinced of the story or that Edelman and Dominion would be the victors if Burlington actually came into play. Arbitragers said past comments from Dominion, however, added credence to the speculation. Dominion has said that it was looking for a takeover in the U.S. Last year, Dominion unsuccessfully bid for Avondale Mills and has maintained a 120 mln dlr line of credit to be used for a U.S. acquisition. A Dominion spokesman said Canadas largest textile producer has been negotiating with many U.S. textile companies, but would not say whether Burlington was among them. There have been acquisitions in this area. Its not unusual that someone could be looking at Burlington after the housecleaning theyve done, said Eileen Gormley of Thomson McKinnon. Burlington sold its domestic operations, which made sheets and other linens, to J.P. Stevens and Co Inc for 110 mln dlrs last year. It also has reorganized management, and focused its operations on businesses that would be less affected by foreign competition, Gormley said. Theyve pulled back so as not to be a commodity marketer, said Gormley. She said in moving more heavily into industrial fabrics, Burlington bought C.H. Masland, which supplies carpets and other fabric to the auto industry. In the past, they just spent and never realized the return on the outlays they did make, she said. You look at their record over the year, and I think theyre poised to be more profitable than they had been in the past, Gormley said. She estimated 1987 earnings of 2.50 dlrs per share, up from 2.01 dlrs per share. Some analysts today recommended clients not buy Burlington at its current levels. Edward Johnson of Johnson Redbook said he recommends selling. He said he believes the stock is worth only about 50 dlrs on a takeover basis and about 46 dlrs on an earnings basis. Some arbitragers, however, said takeover values have been placed on the company of 60 to 65 dlrs per share. After Ashers (Edelman) recent history, a lot of people dont find him very credible anymore, said one arbitrager. Another, however, said Edelman succeeds in forcing managements to take steps to enhance shareholder values even if he doesnt win the target company. Edelman was unsuccessful last year in offers for Lucky Stores Inc and Fruehauf Corp. He did succeed in buying Ponderosa Inc. The stocks of other textile makers rose along with Burlington. J.P. Stevens STN climbed 5/8 to 44-7/8, and Fieldcrest Cannon Inc FLD, the result of a merger of Fieldcrest and Cannon, rose 1-1/8 to 39-3/4. West Point-Pepperell Inc WPM rose 1-7/8 to 67-1/8.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bosnia_and_Herzegovina	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Track_and_field	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Newfoundland_and_Labrador	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Trinidad_and_Tobago	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Provinces_and_territories_of_Canada	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Municipalities_of_Bosnia_and_Herzegovina	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Castile_and_León	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Rock_and_roll	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sistan_and_Baluchestan_Province	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Rhythm_and_blues	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Jammu_and_Kashmir	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Food_and_Drug_Administration	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Kohgiluyeh_and_Boyer-Ahmad_Province	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Home_and_Away	http://dbpedia.org/resource/United_Kingdom_of_Great_Britain_and_Ireland	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Federation_of_Bosnia_and_Herzegovina	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Promotion_and_relegation	http://dbpedia.org/resource/St._John's,_Newfoundland_and_Labrador	http://dbpedia.org/resource/London_and_North_Eastern_Railway	http://dbpedia.org/resource/A-side_and_B-side

GAF	1878	1881	http://dbpedia.org/resource/GAF_Materials_Corporation	Cheap oil feedstocks, the weakened U.S. dollar and a plant utilization rate approaching 90 pct will propel the streamlined U.S. petrochemical industry to record profits this year, with growth expected through at least 1990, major company executives predicted. This bullish outlook for chemical manufacturing and an industrywide move to shed unrelated businesses has prompted GAF Corp (GAF), privately-held Cain Chemical Inc, and other firms to aggressively seek acquisitions of petrochemical plants. Oil companies such as Ashland Oil Inc (ASH), the Kentucky-based oil refiner and marketer, are also shopping for money-making petrochemical businesses to buy. I see us poised at the threshold of a golden period, said Paul Oreffice, chairman of giant Dow Chemical Co (DOW), adding, Theres no major plant capacity being added around the world now. The whole game is bringing out new products and improving the old ones. Analysts say the chemical industrys biggest customers, automobile manufacturers and home builders that use a lot of paints and plastics, are expected to buy quantities this year. U.S. petrochemical plants are currently operating at about 90 pct capacity, reflecting tighter supply that could hike product prices by 30 to 40 pct this year, said John Dosher, managing director of Pace Consultants Inc of Houston. Demand for some products such as styrene could push profit margins up by as much as 300 pct, he said. Oreffice, speaking at a meeting of chemical engineers in Houston, said Dow would easily top the 741 mln dlrs it earned last year and predicted it would have the best year in its history. In 1985, when oil prices were still above 25 dlrs a barrel and chemical exports were adversely affected by the strong U.S. dollar, Dow had profits of 58 mln dlrs. I believe the entire chemical industry is headed for a record year or close to it, Oreffice said. GAF chairman Samuel Heyman estimated that the U.S. chemical industry would report a 20 pct gain in profits during 1987. Last year, the domestic industry earned a total of 13 billion dlrs, a 54 pct leap from 1985. The turn in the fortunes of the once-sickly chemical industry has been brought about by a combination of luck and planning, said Paces John Dosher. Dosher said last years fall in oil prices made feedstocks dramatically cheaper and at the same time the American dollar was weakening against foreign currencies. That helped boost U.S. chemical exports. Also helping to bring supply and demand into balance has been the gradual market absorption of the extra chemical manufacturing capacity created by Middle Eastern oil producers in the early 1980s. Finally, virtually all major U.S. chemical manufacturers have embarked on an extensive corporate restructuring program to mothball inefficient plants, trim the payroll and eliminate unrelated businesses. The restructuring touched off a flurry of friendly and hostile takeover attempts. GAF, which made an unsuccessful attempt in 1985 to acquire Union Carbide Corp UK, recently offered three billion dlrs for Borg Warner Corp BOR, a Chicago manufacturer of plastics and chemicals. Another industry powerhouse, W.R. Grace (GRA) has divested its retailing, restaurant and fertilizer businesses to raise cash for chemical acquisitions. But some experts worry that the chemical industry may be headed for trouble if companies continue turning their back on the manufacturing of staple petrochemical commodities, such as ethylene, in favor of more profitable specialty chemicals that are custom-designed for a small group of buyers. Companies like DuPont (DD) and Monsanto Co MTC spent the past two or three years trying to get out of the commodity chemical business in reaction to how badly the market had deteriorated, Dosher said. But I think they will eventually kill the margins on the profitable chemicals in the niche market. Some top chemical executives share the concern. The challenge for our industry is to keep from getting carried away and repeating past mistakes, GAFs Heyman cautioned. The shift from commodity chemicals may be ill-advised. Specialty businesses do not stay special long. Houston-based Cain Chemical, created this month by the Sterling investment banking group, believes it can generate 700 mln dlrs in annual sales by bucking the industry trend. Chairman Gordon Cain, who previously led a leveraged buyout of Duponts Conoco Incs chemical business, has spent 1.1 billion dlrs since January to buy seven petrochemical plants along the Texas Gulf Coast. The plants produce only basic commodity petrochemicals that are the building blocks of specialty products. This kind of commodity chemical business will never be a glamorous, high-margin business, Cain said, adding that demand is expected to grow by about three pct annually. Garo Armen, an analyst with Dean Witter Reynolds, said chemical makers have also benefitted by increasing demand for plastics as prices become more competitive with aluminum, wood and steel products. Armen estimated the upturn in the chemical business could last as long as four or five years, provided the U.S. economy continues its modest rate of growth.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/GAF_Nomad	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Gaf	http://dbpedia.org/resource/GAF_Jindivik	http://dbpedia.org/resource/GAF_domain	http://dbpedia.org/resource/1976_Sabah_Air_GAF_Nomad_crash

Asiavest Pty Ltd, a commodities futures trader associated with Shintoh and incorporated in Queensland, was placed in receivership earlier this year, he said.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Gold_Coast,_Queensland	http://dbpedia.org/resource/University_of_Queensland	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Queensland_Heritage_Register	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ipswich,_Queensland	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mackay,_Queensland	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Maryborough,_Queensland	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Queensland_Cup	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Queensland_Rail	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Queensland_Reds	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Legislative_Assembly_of_Queensland	http://dbpedia.org/resource/North_Queensland	http://dbpedia.org/resource/North_Queensland_Cowboys	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Gladstone,_Queensland	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sunshine_Coast,_Queensland	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Central_Queensland	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Far_North_Queensland	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Warwick,_Queensland	http://dbpedia.org/resource/South_East_Queensland	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Southport,_Queensland	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Protected_areas_of_Queensland
Edelman	430	437	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Asher_Edelman	The largest U.S. textile maker focused on its own business as its competitors found merger partners, but now Burlington Industries Inc may have restructured itself into an attractive takeover candidate, analysts said. The takeover spotlight fell today on Burlington, which rose 4-7/8 to 52-7/8 on speculation that investor Asher Edelman and Dominion Textiles Inc of Canada bought an almost five pct stake. A published report said Edelman and Dominion jointly acquired a stake in Burlington and were weighing a takeover offer. Edelman would not comment, and a spokesman for Montreal-based Dominion called the report just rumors. Burlington said it did not know if the report was true. Wall Street professionals said they were not convinced of the story or that Edelman and Dominion would be the victors if Burlington actually came into play. Arbitragers said past comments from Dominion, however, added credence to the speculation. Dominion has said that it was looking for a takeover in the U.S. Last year, Dominion unsuccessfully bid for Avondale Mills and has maintained a 120 mln dlr line of credit to be used for a U.S. acquisition. A Dominion spokesman said Canadas largest textile producer has been negotiating with many U.S. textile companies, but would not say whether Burlington was among them. There have been acquisitions in this area. Its not unusual that someone could be looking at Burlington after the housecleaning theyve done, said Eileen Gormley of Thomson McKinnon. Burlington sold its domestic operations, which made sheets and other linens, to J.P. Stevens and Co Inc for 110 mln dlrs last year. It also has reorganized management, and focused its operations on businesses that would be less affected by foreign competition, Gormley said. Theyve pulled back so as not to be a commodity marketer, said Gormley. She said in moving more heavily into industrial fabrics, Burlington bought C.H. Masland, which supplies carpets and other fabric to the auto industry. In the past, they just spent and never realized the return on the outlays they did make, she said. You look at their record over the year, and I think theyre poised to be more profitable than they had been in the past, Gormley said. She estimated 1987 earnings of 2.50 dlrs per share, up from 2.01 dlrs per share. Some analysts today recommended clients not buy Burlington at its current levels. Edward Johnson of Johnson Redbook said he recommends selling. He said he believes the stock is worth only about 50 dlrs on a takeover basis and about 46 dlrs on an earnings basis. Some arbitragers, however, said takeover values have been placed on the company of 60 to 65 dlrs per share. After Ashers (Edelman) recent history, a lot of people dont find him very credible anymore, said one arbitrager. Another, however, said Edelman succeeds in forcing managements to take steps to enhance shareholder values even if he doesnt win the target company. Edelman was unsuccessful last year in offers for Lucky Stores Inc and Fruehauf Corp. He did succeed in buying Ponderosa Inc. The stocks of other textile makers rose along with Burlington. J.P. Stevens STN climbed 5/8 to 44-7/8, and Fieldcrest Cannon Inc FLD, the result of a merger of Fieldcrest and Cannon, rose 1-1/8 to 39-3/4. West Point-Pepperell Inc WPM rose 1-7/8 to 67-1/8.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Randy_Edelman	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Edelman_(firm)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Gerald_Edelman	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Marek_Edelman	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Herb_Edelman	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Marian_Wright_Edelman	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Scott_Edelman	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Paweł_Edelman	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Gregg_Edelman	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ric_Edelman	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Louis_F._Edelman	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Julian_Edelman	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Peter_Edelman	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Maurice_Edelman	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Alan_Edelman	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Alex_Edelman	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Keith_Edelman	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Edelman_v._Jordan	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Richard_Edelman	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Edmund_D._Edelman

Italy	18	23	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Italy	Montedison SPA of Italy said net consolidated profit for its Agrimont Group, formed in June 1986, totalled 1.5 billion lire in 1986. Agrimont SPA, the holding company for Montedisons Agro-Industrial businesses, had sales of 810 billion lire and a net profit of about 1.1 billion lire, after amortization costs of 35 billion lire and a 13 billion lire reduction in the value of inventory due to falling market prices, Montedison said. Agrimont, still wholly owned by Montedison, is taking steps to be traded on the Milan exchange, the company said. The company said that 1986 was characterized by an unstable fertlizer market due to the weak dollar and the decline of international prices for products sold in Europe and the U.S where Agrimont operates through its Conserv division. In pesticides and in animal health care products Agrimont maintained its previous level of revenues and market share in 1986, Montedison said. Montedison said it named Ettore dellIsola to the newly created position of president of Agrimont. Montedison also said it named Renato Picco, managing director of Eridania SPA and Gianfranco Ceroni, managing director of Italiana Olii e Sifi, both of whom are members of the the Ferruzzi Groups management board, to Argimonts board of directors. Ferruzzi owns about 40 pct of Montedison, the company said.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Football_in_Italy	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cinema_of_Italy	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Kingdom_of_Italy	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Italy_national_football_team	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Regions_of_Italy	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Christian_Democracy_(Italy)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Northern_Italy	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Democratic_Party_(Italy)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Provinces_of_Italy	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Southern_Italy	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Italy_national_athletics_team	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Italy_national_rugby_union_team	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Railway_stations_in_Italy	http://dbpedia.org/resource/List_of_political_parties_in_Italy	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Chamber_of_Deputies_(Italy)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Prime_Minister_of_Italy	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Italy_national_under-21_football_team	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Italy_women's_national_volleyball_team	http://dbpedia.org/resource/National_Alliance_(Italy)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ragusa,_Italy
Burlington Industries Inc	80	105	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Burlington_Industries	Dominion Textile Inc considers a published report that it has bought a stake in Burlington Industries Inc and is considering making a joint bid for the company to be a rumor, a company spokesman said. As far as I am concerned and the company is concerned, they are rumors and were not commenting on rumors, spokesman Michel Dufour told Reuters in response to a query. All the information that has been given out publicly is that, yes, Dominion Textile is interested in making an acquisition that big...probably based on that people are starting all sorts of rumors, he said. Dufour said yes when asked whether the report was only a rumor, but said the company was not prepared to comment further. Dominion Textile president and chairman Thomas Bell was out of town and unavailable for comment. Dominion Textile last year made an unsuccesful 104-mln- U.S.-dlr bid for Avondale Mills and has maintained a 120-mln- U.S.-dlr line of credit to be used for an American acquisition. Dufour said the company has been negotiating with many U.S. textile companies but would not say whether Burlington Industries was one of them. Burlingtons stock rose sharply this morning on the report, which said Dominion Textile had joined with U.S. investor Asher Edelman to buy a stake in the company and to consider making a takeover offer. Dominion Textile, which reported operating profit of 11.1 mln Canadian dlrs last year on sales of 926.5 mln dlrs, has repeatedly said it will concentrate on expanding into the U.S. The company has said it plans to diversify into new product and market areas in addition to expanding its textile operations.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Industry	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Automotive_industry	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Burlington,_Vermont	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Recording_Industry_Association_of_America	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Video_game_industry	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Music_industry	http://dbpedia.org/resource/British_Phonographic_Industry	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Australian_Recording_Industry_Association	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Petroleum_industry	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pharmaceutical_industry	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Film_industry	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Burlington,_Ontario	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Kawasaki_Heavy_Industries	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Burlington,_Iowa	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Chemical_industry	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Arms_industry	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Food_industry	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mitsubishi_Heavy_Industries	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Textile_industry	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Light_industry
Plant Vogtle	1240	1252	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Vogtle_Electric_Generating_Plant	An audit submitted to the Georgia Public Service Commission claims that between 944 mln dlrs and 1.8 billion dlrs of the costs of the Plant Vogtle nuclear power station should be disallowed, a Southern Co spokeswoman said. Southerns Georgia Power Co subsidiary has a 45.7 pct interest in the plant and estimated earlier this year it would cost a total of 8.87 billion dlrs. Last year, the plants owners pledged to Georgia regulators they would limit the cost passed on to rate payers to 8.4 billion dlrs. The Southern spokeswoman said the company feels the report by OBrien-Kreitzberg is flawed and biased. She said the report was released yesterday by the state attorney general. Responding to the report today, Georgia Power Chairman Robert W. Scherer told a news conference the conclusions drawn by the firm are not only wrong -- they also reflect the same bias against nuclear power that these auditors have demonstrated in similar cases accross the country. Saying he was not suggesting Georgia power was without fault, Scherer said the audit identified several things I wish we had done differently. Scherer pointed out a report OBrien-Kreitzberg submitted to Georgia regulators in March 1986 projected Georgia Power would not finish Plant Vogtle unit one before the end of 1987. Noting unit one is finished, and we expect it to be in commercial operationg by June, he said the firms latest report ignored the earlier projection, gave the utility no credit for the completion and actually penalized us by suggesting that costs to maintain t he schedule be disallowed. Scherer said the latest audit alleges Georgia Power could have saved 95 mln dlrs if it had stopped using four shifts, seven days a week to speed construction three years sooner. He said this would have delayed completion of the plant for another year and it would have cost several hunderd million dlrs more. Noting the audit said costs were increased 600 mln dlrs by schedule delays totaling 20.5 months, he said First, we have the best concrete placement record in the industry, Second new government regulations after the Three Mile Island incident significantly increased construction time.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Plant	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Flowering_plant	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Perennial_plant	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Native_plant	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ornamental_plant	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Herbaceous_plant	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Annual_plant	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Carnivorous_plant	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Plant_stem	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Aquatic_plant	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Robert_Plant	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Iris_(plant)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Plant_pathology	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Succulent_plant	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Nuclear_power_plant	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Vascular_plant	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Narcissus_(plant)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Woody_plant	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Plant_nursery	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pitcher_plant

Morgan	1208	1214	http://dbpedia.org/resource/J._P._Morgan	J.P. Morgan and Co Inc said its first-quarter earnings fell by 3.2 pct, largely reflecting its previously announced decision to place on non-accrual status its 1.3 billion dlrs of medium- and long-term loans to Brazil. That decision, spurred by Brazils suspension of interest payments on February 20, reduced the quarters net income by 20 mln dlrs to 226.4 mln dlrs, compared with 233.9 mln in the first three months of 1986. Morgan also reported a loss of 1.8 mln dlrs from securities underwriting and trading, in contrast to a gain of 45.4 mln dlrs in the year-earlier period. In the fourth quarter of 1986, Morgan posted other trading losses of 5.5 mln dlrs because of setbacks in the trading and underwriting of Euromarket securities. Conditions in some sectors of the Euromarket remained difficult last quarter, with floating rate notes suffering heavy price falls, but a spokeswoman was unable to say whether Morgans trading losses were restricted to the Euromarket. On the positive side, Morgan reduced its provision for loan losses to 35 mln dlrs from 70 mln a year earlier. Foreign exchange trading income rose to 82 mln dlrs from 72.6 mln and trust income increased to 95.9 mln dlrs from 75.9 mln. Morgan said other operating income, mainly fees and commissions, rose to 102.2 mln dlrs from 88.4 mln, but net investment securities gains dropped to 43.1 mln from 58.1 mln. Net interest earnings were 490.4 mln dlrs in the first quarter, down from 499.4 mln a year earlier, and net yield fell to 2.79 pct from 3.20 pct. If Brazil had not been placed on non-accrual, which means that interest can be recorded as income only when payments are actually received, net interest earnings would have been 525.9 mln dlrs and net yield 2.99 pct. If Brazil does not resume payments, 1987 net would be cut by 72 mln dlrs, Morgan added. After the provision for loan losses, Morgans allowance for credit losses at the end of March totaled 953 mln dlrs compared with 910 mln at end-1986 and 815 mln a year earlier. It reported net recoveries of six mln dlrs after charge-offs of eight mln, compared with net charge-offs of 49 mln dlrs after recoveries of three mln a year earlier. Excluding Brazil, non-accruing loans at quarters end were 583 mln dlrs, down from 633 mln at end-1986 and 684 mln a year earlier. Non-interest expenses rose to 371.1 mln dlrs from 303.5 mln dlrs, with more than half the increase related to personnel costs, Morgan said.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Morgan_Stanley	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Morgan_Freeman	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Morgan_Tsvangirai	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Morgan_State_University	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Lee_Morgan	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Morgan_County,_Indiana	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Piers_Morgan	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Harry_Morgan	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Morgan_City,_Louisiana	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Michèle_Morgan	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tracy_Morgan	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Morgan_County,_Ohio	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Robin_Morgan	http://dbpedia.org/resource/John_Hunt_Morgan	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Lorrie_Morgan	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Morgan_Spurlock	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Frank_Morgan	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Henry_Morgan	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Morgan_Studios	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Reuben_Morgan
Getty Oil Co	655	667	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Getty_Oil	First Boston Corp analyst William Randol recommended the purchase of Texaco Inc today, saying the discount that investors have made in the share price to reflect the ongoing litigation with Pennzoil has been overdone relative to how we expect the case to conclude. Texacos stock rose 1/8 to 34-1/8. On Monday, the stock tumbled four points after the Supreme Court overturned a lower court decision that cut Texacos bond in the 10.3 billion dlr legal dispute with Pennzoil Co PZL to one billion dlrs. Yesterday, a Texas court granted a temporary injunction on the bond issue pending a hearing next week. The current litigation arose from Texacos buyout of Getty Oil Co in 1984. Pennzoil sued, arguing its earlier agreement to buy Getty was binding. Two Texas state courts upheld Pennzoils position. Randol, noting that the stock has suffered a great deal in the two years since the litigation was filed, said we recognize the legal problems but think investors have overdone it. He said the stock is selling at 48 pct of its asset value, and we think it represents a good value at this level.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Oil	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Oil_painting	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Oil_field	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Olive_oil	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Fuel_oil	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Oil_refinery	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Oil_tanker	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Oil_well	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Palm_oil	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Standard_Oil	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Essential_oil	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Oil_platform	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Oil_paint	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Vegetable_oil	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Oil_shale	http://dbpedia.org/resource/1973_oil_crisis	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Getty_Images	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Oil_spill	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Midnight_Oil	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Gulf_Oil

Lucky Stores Inc	2977	2993	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Lucky_Stores	The largest U.S. textile maker focused on its own business as its competitors found merger partners, but now Burlington Industries Inc may have restructured itself into an attractive takeover candidate, analysts said. The takeover spotlight fell today on Burlington, which rose 4-7/8 to 52-7/8 on speculation that investor Asher Edelman and Dominion Textiles Inc of Canada bought an almost five pct stake. A published report said Edelman and Dominion jointly acquired a stake in Burlington and were weighing a takeover offer. Edelman would not comment, and a spokesman for Montreal-based Dominion called the report just rumors. Burlington said it did not know if the report was true. Wall Street professionals said they were not convinced of the story or that Edelman and Dominion would be the victors if Burlington actually came into play. Arbitragers said past comments from Dominion, however, added credence to the speculation. Dominion has said that it was looking for a takeover in the U.S. Last year, Dominion unsuccessfully bid for Avondale Mills and has maintained a 120 mln dlr line of credit to be used for a U.S. acquisition. A Dominion spokesman said Canadas largest textile producer has been negotiating with many U.S. textile companies, but would not say whether Burlington was among them. There have been acquisitions in this area. Its not unusual that someone could be looking at Burlington after the housecleaning theyve done, said Eileen Gormley of Thomson McKinnon. Burlington sold its domestic operations, which made sheets and other linens, to J.P. Stevens and Co Inc for 110 mln dlrs last year. It also has reorganized management, and focused its operations on businesses that would be less affected by foreign competition, Gormley said. Theyve pulled back so as not to be a commodity marketer, said Gormley. She said in moving more heavily into industrial fabrics, Burlington bought C.H.

Reuters	1112	1119	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Reuters	Exchanges and telecommunications authorities should abolish their restrictions on full and free dissemination of information to the investment and banking communities, Reuters Holdings Plc RTRS.L chairman Sir Christopher Hogg said. In the 1986 annual repoprt, he said lengthy negotiations had brought agreement with the Tokyo and London Stock Exchanges for fuller, but still not complete, access to market data through Reuter services. Many other markets maintain restrictions, he added. Hogg said members of some markets appear to believe that information restrictions protected their interests. In other cases, exchanges seem to be limiting the distribution of data in order to provide competitive advantage to their own commercial information businesses. He also noted that despite increasing liberalisation in the telecommunications field, some countries continue to protect their state monopolies at the expense of other economic sectors. Reuter dealing services remain excluded from such countries. As a result, banking communities serving entire economies are put at a competitive disadvantage, he added. Reuters increased its 1986 pre-tax profit by 39 pct from the previous year to 130.1 mln stg on a 43 pct rise in revenues to 620.9 mln stg. Earnings per ordinary share were up 47 pct to 19.4p. The annual shareholder meeting will be held in London on April 29.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thomson_Reuters	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Reuters_Group	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Reuters_3000_Xtra	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thomson_Reuters_Foundation	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thomson_Reuters_Indices	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thomson_Reuters_Citation_Laureates	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Reuters_Digital_Vision_Program	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Reuters_Institute_for_the_Study_of_Journalism	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thomson_Reuters_Business_Classification	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Reuters_TV	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Reuters_Insider	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Reuters_Market_Data_System	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Calais_(Reuters_product)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thomson_Reuters_Realized_Volatility_Index	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thomson_Reuters_Messenger	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Reuters_Market_Light	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Reuters_Instrument_Code	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thomson_Reuters_league_tables

He said this coupon  spokesman said. He said this coupon "pass,pass," which adds permanent reserves to the banking system, was for regular delivery tomorrow. Dealers said that Federal funds were trading at 6-7/16 pct when the Fed announced the operation. Economists had been expecting the Fed to do this because of the need to offset seasonal factors expected to drain reserves heavily over the next few weeks.

Brasilia	194	202	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Brasília	Storage problems with Brazils record grain crop are likely to result in losses of about five mln tonnes, an Agriculture Ministry spokesman said. Ministry spokesman Leonardo Brito, speaking from Brasilia, told Reuters he believed that about five mln tonnes of this years estimated crop of 65 mln tonnes would be lost. He said part of this would be the normal loss inevitable in harvesting, but that most of it would stem from storage problems. Brazil has a storage capacity of 66 mln tonnes, theoretically sufficient for the crop. But Brito said that the storage capacity was badly distributed. The states of Sao Paulo, Parana and Rio Grande do Sul had between them 70 pct of the nations capacity, but were responsible for only 50 to 60 pct of production. The biggest problems are concentrated in the Centre-West growing regions, where rising production has outpaced storage capacity. Brito said the Centre-West, whose crops include soya and maize, had between 30 and 40 pct of the nations grains production but only 20 pct of its storage space. In addition to the poor distribution of storage units, there is the problem that too much of the capacity is geared to storing grain in sacks, while not enough is suitable for storing loose grain, Brito said. Finally, there is a shortage of lorries to transport the crops. The sheer scale of the task in transporting the record crop has been evident from television reports, which have shown enormous queues of lorries waiting outside granaries.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Brasilia_TV_Tower	http://dbpedia.org/resource/C.D._Brasilia	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Club_Social,_Cultural_y_Deportivo_Brasilia	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Brasilia_Digital_TV_Tower	http://dbpedia.org/resource/293_Brasilia	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Carmen_Brasilia	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Brasilia_Presidential_Act	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Buckleria_brasilia	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Embraer_EMB_120_Brasilia	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Higher_Education_Institute_of_Brasilia	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Brasilia_Hip_Hop	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Brasilia_lyrefin	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Wésley_Brasilia

Rosenberg	2484	2493	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Steven_Rosenberg	Promising new findings in the use of a controversial experimental drug called Interleukin-2 as a cure for cancer will be published in the April 9 issue of the prestigious New England Journal of Medicine, according to a Wall Street analyst who has obtained an advance copy of the magazine. Among interleukins principal U. S. makers are Cetus Corp CTUS, headquartered in Emeryville, Calif., and Immunex Corp IMNX, based in Seattle, Wash. The journal, to be released late today, contains two articles reporting high remission rates several cancer types. The journal also contains a signed editorial concluding that the new results mark a significant milestone in the search for a successful immunotherapy for cancer. Interleukin-2, also known as IL-2, is a substance naturally produced by living cells in the laboratory. The drug is controversial because it was widely praised as a promising cancer treatment in early reports on its effectiveness in late 1985, only to come under criticism a year later for its failure to live up to its promise and due to its ravaging side effects. One of the new studies, conducted by Dr. William West of Biotherapeutics Inc of Franklin, Tenn., is particularly significant because it found far fewer harsh side effects after it changed the way in which the drug is administered. In that study, researchers administered IL-2 to 48 cancer patients and found a 50-pct remission rate for kidney cancers and a 50 pct remission rate for melanoma, a type of skin cancer, according to Prudential-Bache Securities Stuart Weisbrod, who obtained the advance copy of the magazine. For rectal and colon cancer, the researchers found no remissions, but none of the 48 patients treated had side effects serious enough to be placed under intensive hospital care, according to the article. In the second study, whose principal author is Dr. Steven Rosenberg of the National Cancer Institute, researchers administered IL-2 to 157 cancer patients and found a 33 pct remission rate in cancers of the kidney, a 27 pct rate in melanomas and a 15 pct rate in cancers of the colon and rectum. In the National Cancer Institute trials, a total of four patients died, the magazine reported, confirming the harshness of the drugs side effects as originally administered. Perhaps we are at the end of the beginning of the search for successful immunotherapy for cancer, said the editorial, signed by John Durant of Philadelphias Chase Cancer Center. These observations reported by Rosenberg and West surely did not describe successful practical approaches ready for widespread applications in the therapy of cancer patients, the editorial said. On the other hand, if they reflect, as seems possible, a successful manipulation of the cellular immune system, then we may be near the end of our search for a meaningful direction in the immunuotherapy of cancer, the editorial concluded.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Alfred_Rosenberg	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Willow_Rosenberg	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Rosenberg,_Texas	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Carol_Rosenberg	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sulzbach-Rosenberg	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Aaron_Rosenberg	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Julius_and_Ethel_Rosenberg	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Isaac_Rosenberg	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Alan_Rosenberg	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Howard_Rosenberg	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Stuart_Rosenberg	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Max_Rosenberg	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tom_Rosenberg	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hilding_Rosenberg	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Scott_Rosenberg	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Harold_Rosenberg	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Melissa_Rosenberg	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pierre_Rosenberg	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Markus_Rosenberg	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Adelaide_of_Löwenstein-Wertheim-Rosenberg
Basra	1028	1033	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Basra	Iran decided to continue its operations east of Basra to destroy Iraqs forces, Iranian Prime Minister Mir-Hossein Mousavi told Tehran Radio. That seems to be the best spot for the complete destruction of (Iraqi President) Saddams forces. This is why it was decided that the operations would forcefully continue there, he said. At the same time, we have maintained our ability to act throughout the length of the fronts, Mousavi told the radio, monitored by the British Broadcasting Corporation. Tehran Radio reported over 1,500 Iraqi casualties today as Iran continued its Karbala-8 operation launched early yesterday. Iran said over 2,600 Iraqis had been killed or wounded yesterday. Iraq said today its forces had beaten back the latest attacks inflicting heavy casualties. Mousavi told Tehran radio that on the whole, our advances have broken the back of the military forces of Saddam. Earlier today the Iranian news agency IRNA said Tehrans forces were stabilising new positions after their assault on Iraqi lines defending Basra, Iraqs second city. In Baghdad, a military spokesman said Iraqi warplanes today destroyed an oil pumping station and a production unit at Irans Ahvaz field.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Basra_Governorate	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Asif_Basra	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Basra_International_Airport	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hasan_of_Basra	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Basra_Memorial	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Geeta_Basra	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Basra_governorate_election,_2009	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Basra_Vilayet	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Al-Hariri_of_Basra	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Battle_of_Basra_(2008)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Basra_Eyalet	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Timeline_of_Basra	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Basra_War_Cemetery	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Riaz_Basra	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Basra,_Morocco	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Basra_(2008_film)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Battle_of_Basra_(2003)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Battle_of_Basra_(1914)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Basra_Sports_City	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Basra_(album)

Congress	60	68	http://dbpedia.org/resource/United_States_Congress	Securities and Exchange Commission John Shad said he wanted Congress to write a better definition of insider trading but thought action should wait until the Supreme Court ruled on an insider trading case. Id like the benefit of the Winans decision before deciding on a definition, Shad told a Senate Appropriations subcommittee hearing. Shad was refering to the appeal by former Wall Street Journal reporter R. Foster Winans of his conviction on insider trading charges for telling a friend in advance what stocks he was going to write about in his column. The stocks usually went up or down in price depending on Winans recommendation. He said insider trading accounted for only 11 percent of the SECs enforcement activities last year despite the publicity given to recent major cases. Insider trading makes up only a tiny fraction of one pct of the 50 billion dlrs of daily securities trading, Shad said. Shad asked for a budget increase so the SEC could enlarge its enforcement staff by 20 this year and 73 next year to deal with all types of securities fraud. Shad said he hoped to start his new duties as U.S. Ambassador to the Netherlands by June. He said he did not know when his successor would be named by President Reagan.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Indian_National_Congress	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Library_of_Congress	http://dbpedia.org/resource/African_National_Congress	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Congress_Poland	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Nepali_Congress	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Continental_Congress	http://dbpedia.org/resource/LX_Legislature_of_the_Mexican_Congress	http://dbpedia.org/resource/LXI_Legislature_of_the_Mexican_Congress	http://dbpedia.org/resource/LXII_Legislature_of_the_Mexican_Congress	http://dbpedia.org/resource/LIX_Legislature_of_the_Mexican_Congress	http://dbpedia.org/resource/113th_United_States_Congress	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Trades_Union_Congress	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Nationalist_Congress_Party	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Congress_of_Vienna	http://dbpedia.org/resource/All_India_Trinamool_Congress	http://dbpedia.org/resource/54th_United_States_Congress	http://dbpedia.org/resource/LVIII_Legislature_of_the_Mexican_Congress	http://dbpedia.org/resource/53rd_United_States_Congress	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Congress_of_Deputies_(Spain)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/64th_United_States_Congress

Far East	391	399	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Far_East	World output of staple foods maintained growth in 1986, following a record harvest the year before, and most of the increase was in developing countries, the director general of the U.N.s Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) said. Speaking to FAOs committee on world food security, Edouard Saouma said sub-Saharan Africa registered a cereal production increase of 3.6 pct in 1986 and the Far East also continued to increase production. Despite ample supplies worldwide, many countries face problems in paying for all the food they need, he said. Saouma said many of the developing worlds food problems were the result of chaotic world trade. He said it was vital to promote employment to improve the food-security situation of the poor, with policy reforms in developing countries to remove existing disincentives to production so that agriculture could play a greater role in stimulating economic growth.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/East_Africa_Time	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Fars_Province	http://dbpedia.org/resource/East_Germany	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Middle_East	http://dbpedia.org/resource/East_Prussia	http://dbpedia.org/resource/East_Azerbaijan_Province	http://dbpedia.org/resource/East_Timor	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Russian_Far_East	http://dbpedia.org/resource/East_Sussex	http://dbpedia.org/resource/East_Japan_Railway_Company	http://dbpedia.org/resource/East_Africa	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dutch_East_Indies	http://dbpedia.org/resource/East_India_Company	http://dbpedia.org/resource/East_Asia	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Near_East	http://dbpedia.org/resource/East_Java	http://dbpedia.org/resource/East_Berlin	http://dbpedia.org/resource/East_Riding_of_Yorkshire	http://dbpedia.org/resource/East_Pakistan	http://dbpedia.org/resource/East_Lothian
Edelman	2680	2687	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Asher_Edelman	The largest U.S. textile maker focused on its own business as its competitors found merger partners, but now Burlington Industries Inc may have restructured itself into an attractive takeover candidate, analysts said. The takeover spotlight fell today on Burlington, which rose 4-7/8 to 52-7/8 on speculation that investor Asher Edelman and Dominion Textiles Inc of Canada bought an almost five pct stake. A published report said Edelman and Dominion jointly acquired a stake in Burlington and were weighing a takeover offer. Edelman would not comment, and a spokesman for Montreal-based Dominion called the report just rumors. Burlington said it did not know if the report was true. Wall Street professionals said they were not convinced of the story or that Edelman and Dominion would be the victors if Burlington actually came into play. Arbitragers said past comments from Dominion, however, added credence to the speculation. Dominion has said that it was looking for a takeover in the U.S. Last year, Dominion unsuccessfully bid for Avondale Mills and has maintained a 120 mln dlr line of credit to be used for a U.S. acquisition. A Dominion spokesman said Canadas largest textile producer has been negotiating with many U.S. textile companies, but would not say whether Burlington was among them. There have been acquisitions in this area. Its not unusual that someone could be looking at Burlington after the housecleaning theyve done, said Eileen Gormley of Thomson McKinnon. Burlington sold its domestic operations, which made sheets and other linens, to J.P. Stevens and Co Inc for 110 mln dlrs last year. It also has reorganized management, and focused its operations on businesses that would be less affected by foreign competition, Gormley said. Theyve pulled back so as not to be a commodity marketer, said Gormley. She said in moving more heavily into industrial fabrics, Burlington bought C.H. Masland, which supplies carpets and other fabric to the auto industry. In the past, they just spent and never realized the return on the outlays they did make, she said. You look at their record over the year, and I think theyre poised to be more profitable than they had been in the past, Gormley said. She estimated 1987 earnings of 2.50 dlrs per share, up from 2.01 dlrs per share. Some analysts today recommended clients not buy Burlington at its current levels. Edward Johnson of Johnson Redbook said he recommends selling. He said he believes the stock is worth only about 50 dlrs on a takeover basis and about 46 dlrs on an earnings basis. Some arbitragers, however, said takeover values have been placed on the company of 60 to 65 dlrs per share. After Ashers (Edelman) recent history, a lot of people dont find him very credible anymore, said one arbitrager. Another, however, said Edelman succeeds in forcing managements to take steps to enhance shareholder values even if he doesnt win the target company.

National Cancer Institute	1880	1905	http://dbpedia.org/resource/National_Cancer_Institute	Promising new findings in the use of a controversial experimental drug called Interleukin-2 as a cure for cancer will be published in the April 9 issue of the prestigious New England Journal of Medicine, according to a Wall Street analyst who has obtained an advance copy of the magazine. Among interleukins principal U. S. makers are Cetus Corp CTUS, headquartered in Emeryville, Calif., and Immunex Corp IMNX, based in Seattle, Wash. The journal, to be released late today, contains two articles reporting high remission rates several cancer types. The journal also contains a signed editorial concluding that the new results mark a significant milestone in the search for a successful immunotherapy for cancer. Interleukin-2, also known as IL-2, is a substance naturally produced by living cells in the laboratory. The drug is controversial because it was widely praised as a promising cancer treatment in early reports on its effectiveness in late 1985, only to come under criticism a year later for its failure to live up to its promise and due to its ravaging side effects. One of the new studies, conducted by Dr. William West of Biotherapeutics Inc of Franklin, Tenn., is particularly significant because it found far fewer harsh side effects after it changed the way in which the drug is administered. In that study, researchers administered IL-2 to 48 cancer patients and found a 50-pct remission rate for kidney cancers and a 50 pct remission rate for melanoma, a type of skin cancer, according to Prudential-Bache Securities Stuart Weisbrod, who obtained the advance copy of the magazine. For rectal and colon cancer, the researchers found no remissions, but none of the 48 patients treated had side effects serious enough to be placed under intensive hospital care, according to the article. In the second study, whose principal author is Dr. Steven Rosenberg of the National Cancer Institute, researchers administered IL-2 to 157 cancer patients and found a 33 pct remission rate in cancers of the kidney, a 27 pct rate in melanomas and a 15 pct rate in cancers of the colon and rectum. In the National Cancer Institute trials, a total of four patients died, the magazine reported, confirming the harshness of the drugs side effects as originally administered. Perhaps we are at the end of the beginning of the search for successful immunotherapy for cancer, said the editorial, signed by John Durant of Philadelphias Chase Cancer Center. These observations reported by Rosenberg and West surely did not describe successful practical approaches ready for widespread applications in the therapy of cancer patients, the editorial said. On the other hand, if they reflect, as seems possible, a successful manipulation of the cellular immune system, then we may be near the end of our search for a meaningful direction in the immunuotherapy of cancer, the editorial concluded.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/National_Register_of_Historic_Places	http://dbpedia.org/resource/National_Football_League	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cancer	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Indian_National_Congress	http://dbpedia.org/resource/National_Hockey_League	http://dbpedia.org/resource/National_Basketball_Association	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Massachusetts_Institute_of_Technology	http://dbpedia.org/resource/National_Historic_Landmark	http://dbpedia.org/resource/National_League	http://dbpedia.org/resource/National_Park_Service	http://dbpedia.org/resource/National_park	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Breast_cancer	http://dbpedia.org/resource/National_Institutes_of_Health	http://dbpedia.org/resource/National_Collegiate_Athletic_Association	http://dbpedia.org/resource/National_Science_Foundation	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Lung_cancer	http://dbpedia.org/resource/National_Action_Party_(Mexico)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/National_Topographic_System	http://dbpedia.org/resource/England_national_football_team	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Canadian_National_Railway
Mir-Hossein Mousavi	102	121	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mir-Hossein_Mousavi	Iran decided to continue its operations east of Basra to destroy Iraqs forces, Iranian Prime Minister Mir-Hossein Mousavi told Tehran Radio. That seems to be the best spot for the complete destruction of (Iraqi President) Saddams forces. This is why it was decided that the operations would forcefully continue there, he said. At the same time, we have maintained our ability to act throughout the length of the fronts, Mousavi told the radio, monitored by the British Broadcasting Corporation. Tehran Radio reported over 1,500 Iraqi casualties today as Iran continued its Karbala-8 operation launched early yesterday. Iran said over 2,600 Iraqis had been killed or wounded yesterday. Iraq said today its forces had beaten back the latest attacks inflicting heavy casualties. Mousavi told Tehran radio that on the whole, our advances have broken the back of the military forces of Saddam. Earlier today the Iranian news agency IRNA said Tehrans forces were stabilising new positions after their assault on Iraqi lines defending Basra, Iraqs second city. In Baghdad, a military spokesman said Iraqi warplanes today destroyed an oil pumping station and a production unit at Irans Ahvaz field.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Kaveh_Mousavi	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mohammad_Mousavi_(volleyball)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ali_Mousavi	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Abdul-Karim_Mousavi_Ardebili	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mohammad_Mousavi_Khoeiniha	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Syed_Askar_Mousavi	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Alireza_Mousavi	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Iman_Mousavi	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mir-Hossein_Mousavi_presidential_campaign,_2009	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Seyed_Mohsen_Mousavi	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hossein_Mousavi_Tabrizi	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Kazem_Mousavi-Bojnourdi	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Abdolvahed_Mousavi_Lari	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Abdolrahim_Mousavi	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ahmad_Mousavi	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Taraneh_Mousavi	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Fakhraddin_Mousavi	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Jamaluddin_Mousavi	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Farid_Mousavi	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ayoub_Mousavi
Corrientes	743	753	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Corrientes_Province	Argentine grain producers adjusted their yield estimates for the 1986/87 coarse grain crop downward in the week to yesterday after the heavy rains at the end of March and beginning of April, trade sources said. They said sunflower, maize and sorghum production estimates had been reduced despite some later warm, dry weather, which has allowed a return to harvesting in some areas. However, as showers fell intermittently after last weekend, producers feared another spell of prolonged and intense rain could cause more damage to crops already badly hit this season. Rains in the middle of last week reached an average of 27 millimetres in parts of Buenos Aires province, 83 mm in Cordoba, 41 in Santa Fe, 50 in Entre Rios and Misiones, 95 in Corrientes, eight in Chaco and 35 in Formosa. There was no rainfall in the same period in La Pampa. Producers feared continued damp conditions could produce rotting and lead to still lower yield estimates for all the crops, including soybean. However, as the lands began drying later in the week harvesting advanced considerably, reaching between 36 and 40 pct of the area sown in the case of sunflower. Deterioration of the sunflower crop evident in harvested material in Cordoba, La Pampa and Buenos Aires forced yield estimates per hectare to be adjusted down again. The seasons sunflowerseed production is now forecast at 2.1 mln to 2.3 mln tonnes, against 2.2 mln to 2.4 mln forecast last week and down 43.9 to 48.8 pct on the 1985/86 record of 4.1 mln. Area sown to sunflowers was two to 2.2 mln hectares, 29.9 to 36.3 pct below the record 3.14 mln hectares last season. Maize harvesting has also reached 36 to 40 pct of the area sown. It is near completion in Cordoba and Santa Fe and will begin in La Pampa and southern Buenos Aires later in April. Production estimates for maize were down from last week at 9.5 mln to 9.8 mln tonnes, against 9.6 mln to 9.9 mln estimated previously. This is 22.2 to 23.4 pct below the 12.4 mln to 12.6 mln tonnes estimated by private sources for the 1985/86 crop and 21.9 to 25.8 pct down on the official figure of 12.8 mln tonnes. Maize was sown on 3.58 mln to 3.78 mln hectares, two to seven pct down on last seasons 3.85 mln. Sorghum was harvested on 23 to 25 pct of the area sown in Cordoba, Santa Fe and Chaco. Harvest will start in La Pampa and Buenos Aires in mid-April. The total area sown was 1.23 mln to 1.30 mln hectares, 10.3 to 15.2 pct down on the 1.45 mln sown last season. The new forecast for the sorghum crop is 2.9 mln to 3.2 mln tonnes compared with three mln to 3.3 mln forecast last week, and is 23.8 to 29.3 pct down on last seasons 4.1 mln to 4.2 mln tonne crop. The soybean crop for this season was not adjusted, remaining at a record 7.5 mln to 7.7 mln tonnes, up 4.2 to 5.5 pct on the 7.2 mln to 7.3 mln estimated by private sources for 1985/86 and 5.6 to 8.5 pct higher than the official figure of 7.1 mln. The area sown to soybeans this season was a record 3.7 mln to 3.8 mln hectares, 10.8 to 13.8 pct up on the record 3.34 mln sown in 1985/86. The soybean crop is showing excessive moisture in some areas and producers fear they may discover more damage. Some experimental harvesting was carried out in Santa Fe on areas making up only about one pct of the total crop but details on this were not available. Preparation of the fields for the 1987/88 wheat crop, which will be sown between May and August or September, has so far not been as intense as in previous years.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Corrientes	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Avenida_Corrientes	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mercedes,_Corrientes	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Regatas_Corrientes	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cabo_Corrientes	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ituzaingó,_Corrientes	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Santo_Tomé,_Corrientes	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sauce,_Corrientes	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Diego_Corrientes_Mateos	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Esquina,_Corrientes	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Yapeyú,_Corrientes	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Saladas,_Corrientes	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Monte_Caseros,_Corrientes	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mburucuyá,_Corrientes	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Santa_Lucía,_Corrientes	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Itatí,_Corrientes	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Concepción,_Corrientes	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Huracán_Corrientes	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Guaviraví,_Corrientes	http://dbpedia.org/resource/San_Roque,_Corrientes
Continental	521	532	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Continental_Bank_of_Canada	Continental Bank of Canada said shareholders approved a capital reorganization to allow an initial payout by the end of May to common shareholders from last years 200 mln Canadian dlr sale of most Continental assets to Lloyds Bank PLCs Lloyds Bank Canada.

Morgan	995	1001	http://dbpedia.org/resource/J._P._Morgan	J.P. Morgan and Co Inc said its first-quarter earnings fell by 3.2 pct, largely reflecting its previously announced decision to place on non-accrual status its 1.3 billion dlrs of medium- and long-term loans to Brazil. That decision, spurred by Brazils suspension of interest payments on February 20, reduced the quarters net income by 20 mln dlrs to 226.4 mln dlrs, compared with 233.9 mln in the first three months of 1986. Morgan also reported a loss of 1.8 mln dlrs from securities underwriting and trading, in contrast to a gain of 45.4 mln dlrs in the year-earlier period. In the fourth quarter of 1986, Morgan posted other trading losses of 5.5 mln dlrs because of setbacks in the trading and underwriting of Euromarket securities. Conditions in some sectors of the Euromarket remained difficult last quarter, with floating rate notes suffering heavy price falls, but a spokeswoman was unable to say whether Morgans trading losses were restricted to the Euromarket. On the positive side, Morgan reduced its provision for loan losses to 35 mln dlrs from 70 mln a year earlier. Foreign exchange trading income rose to 82 mln dlrs from 72.6 mln and trust income increased to 95.9 mln dlrs from 75.9 mln. Morgan said other operating income, mainly fees and commissions, rose to 102.2 mln dlrs from 88.4 mln, but net investment securities gains dropped to 43.1 mln from 58.1 mln. Net interest earnings were 490.4 mln dlrs in the first quarter, down from 499.4 mln a year earlier, and net yield fell to 2.79 pct from 3.20 pct. If Brazil had not been placed on non-accrual, which means that interest can be recorded as income only when payments are actually received, net interest earnings would have been 525.9 mln dlrs and net yield 2.99 pct. If Brazil does not resume payments, 1987 net would be cut by 72 mln dlrs, Morgan added. After the provision for loan losses, Morgans allowance for credit losses at the end of March totaled 953 mln dlrs compared with 910 mln at end-1986 and 815 mln a year earlier. It reported net recoveries of six mln dlrs after charge-offs of eight mln, compared with net charge-offs of 49 mln dlrs after recoveries of three mln a year earlier. Excluding Brazil, non-accruing loans at quarters end were 583 mln dlrs, down from 633 mln at end-1986 and 684 mln a year earlier. Non-interest expenses rose to 371.1 mln dlrs from 303.5 mln dlrs, with more than half the increase related to personnel costs, Morgan said.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Morgan_Stanley	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Morgan_Freeman	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Morgan_Tsvangirai	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Morgan_State_University	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Lee_Morgan	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Morgan_County,_Indiana	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Piers_Morgan	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Harry_Morgan	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Morgan_City,_Louisiana	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Michèle_Morgan	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tracy_Morgan	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Morgan_County,_Ohio	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Robin_Morgan	http://dbpedia.org/resource/John_Hunt_Morgan	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Lorrie_Morgan	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Morgan_Spurlock	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Frank_Morgan	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Henry_Morgan	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Morgan_Studios	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Reuben_Morgan

Asiavest Pty Ltd, a commodities futures trader associated with Shintoh and incorporated in Queensland, was placed in receivership earlier this year, he said.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/London_Stock_Exchange	http://dbpedia.org/resource/New_York_Stock_Exchange	http://dbpedia.org/resource/U.S._Securities_and_Exchange_Commission	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Stock_exchange	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Telephone_exchange	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Foreign_exchange_market	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Exchange_rate	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pathé_Exchange	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bombay_Stock_Exchange	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hong_Kong_Stock_Exchange	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Toronto_Stock_Exchange	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Exchange-traded_fund	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Oslo_Stock_Exchange	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tokyo_Stock_Exchange	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Internet_exchange_point	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Futures_exchange	http://dbpedia.org/resource/German_Academic_Exchange_Service	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Singapore_Exchange	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Shanghai_Stock_Exchange	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Microsoft_Exchange_Server
Gerhard Stoltenberg	215	234	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Gerhard_Stoltenberg	Top officials of leading industrial nations arrived at the U.S. Treasury main building to begin a meeting of the Group of Five. Officials seen arriving by Reuter correspondents included West German Finance Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg and Bundesbank President Karl Otto Poehl, French Finance Minister Edouard Balladur and his central banker Jacques de Larosiere. Also seen arriving were Japanese Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa and Japans central bank governor Satoshi Sumita and British Chancellor of the Exchequer and central bank governor Robin Leigh Pemberton. There was no immediate sign of Italian or Canadian officials. Monetary sources have said a fully blown meeting of the Group of Seven is expected to begin around 3 p.m. local time (1900 gmt) and last at least until 6 p.m. (2200 gmt), when a communique is expected to be issued. Italian sources said Italian acting Finance Minister Giovanni Goria met Treasury Secretary James Baker last night. At those talks Baker apparently convinced Goria, who declined to attend the February meeting of the Group of Seven in Paris, that Italy would participate fully in any meaningful decisions.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Gerhard_Schröder	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Jens_Stoltenberg	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Jason_Stoltenberg	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Gerhard_Richter	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Gerhard_Berger	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Joseph_Gerhard_Zuccarini	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Gerhard_Dammann	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Gerhard_Lamprecht	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Gerhard_Bienert	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thorvald_Stoltenberg	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Gerhard_Herzberg	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Gerhard_Ritterband	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Roberto_Gerhard	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Gerhard_Marcks	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Gerhard_Gentzen	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Gerhard_von_Scharnhorst	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Wilhelm_Gerhard_Walpers	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Gerhard_Riedmann	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Gerhard_Fieseler	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Gerhard_Munthe
DSM	624	627	http://dbpedia.org/resource/DSM_(company)	Dutch state-owned chemical firm NV DSM (DSMN.AS), the former Dutch state mines, which today reported a 2.5 pct increase in 1986 net profit to 412 mln guilders, said it was poised to be privatised, possibly next year. DSM chairman Hans van Liemt told journalists We have done our homework. Were ready. It is up to the state now. He said a public sale of 30 pct of DSMs assets in 1988 was not unlikely, but the timing of the sell-off was entirely in the hands of Parliament. Dutch Finance Minister Onno Ruding is known to be a proponent of privatisation, and the centre-right government coalition mentioned plans to privatise DSM in its policy declaration last autumn. Van Liemt would not speculate on a possible market price, but said his company had raised its total 1986 dividend to 98 mln guilders, almost 25 pct of 1986 net profit. We ought to be able to match our German competitors on price earnings ratio, although the Amsterdam bourse generally has a lower ratio than the worlds major exchanges,  he said. The average Dutch price/earnings ratio is 10.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/DSM-5	http://dbpedia.org/resource/DSM_CC	http://dbpedia.org/resource/DSM-IV_codes	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Structured_Clinical_Interview_for_DSM-IV	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Homosexuality_in_DSM
Formosa	780	787	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Formosa_Province	Argentine grain producers adjusted their yield estimates for the 1986/87 coarse grain crop downward in the week to yesterday after the heavy rains at the end of March and beginning of April, trade sources said. They said sunflower, maize and sorghum production estimates had been reduced despite some later warm, dry weather, which has allowed a return to harvesting in some areas. However, as showers fell intermittently after last weekend, producers feared another spell of prolonged and intense rain could cause more damage to crops already badly hit this season. Rains in the middle of last week reached an average of 27 millimetres in parts of Buenos Aires province, 83 mm in Cordoba, 41 in Santa Fe, 50 in Entre Rios and Misiones, 95 in Corrientes, eight in Chaco and 35 in Formosa. There was no rainfall in the same period in La Pampa. Producers feared continued damp conditions could produce rotting and lead to still lower yield estimates for all the crops, including soybean. However, as the lands began drying later in the week harvesting advanced considerably, reaching between 36 and 40 pct of the area sown in the case of sunflower. Deterioration of the sunflower crop evident in harvested material in Cordoba, La Pampa and Buenos Aires forced yield estimates per hectare to be adjusted down again. The seasons sunflowerseed production is now forecast at 2.1 mln to 2.3 mln tonnes, against 2.2 mln to 2.4 mln forecast last week and down 43.9 to 48.8 pct on the 1985/86 record of 4.1 mln. Area sown to sunflowers was two to 2.2 mln hectares, 29.9 to 36.3 pct below the record 3.14 mln hectares last season. Maize harvesting has also reached 36 to 40 pct of the area sown. It is near completion in Cordoba and Santa Fe and will begin in La Pampa and southern Buenos Aires later in April. Production estimates for maize were down from last week at 9.5 mln to 9.8 mln tonnes, against 9.6 mln to 9.9 mln estimated previously. This is 22.2 to 23.4 pct below the 12.4 mln to 12.6 mln tonnes estimated by private sources for the 1985/86 crop and 21.9 to 25.8 pct down on the official figure of 12.8 mln tonnes. Maize was sown on 3.58 mln to 3.78 mln hectares, two to seven pct down on last seasons 3.85 mln. Sorghum was harvested on 23 to 25 pct of the area sown in Cordoba, Santa Fe and Chaco. Harvest will start in La Pampa and Buenos Aires in mid-April. The total area sown was 1.23 mln to 1.30 mln hectares, 10.3 to 15.2 pct down on the 1.45 mln sown last season. The new forecast for the sorghum crop is 2.9 mln to 3.2 mln tonnes compared with three mln to 3.3 mln forecast last week, and is 23.8 to 29.3 pct down on last seasons 4.1 mln to 4.2 mln tonne crop. The soybean crop for this season was not adjusted, remaining at a record 7.5 mln to 7.7 mln tonnes, up 4.2 to 5.5 pct on the 7.2 mln to 7.3 mln estimated by private sources for 1985/86 and 5.6 to 8.5 pct higher than the official figure of 7.1 mln. The area sown to soybeans this season was a record 3.7 mln to 3.8 mln hectares, 10.8 to 13.8 pct up on the record 3.34 mln sown in 1985/86. The soybean crop is showing excessive moisture in some areas and producers fear they may discover more damage. Some experimental harvesting was carried out in Santa Fe on areas making up only about one pct of the total crop but details on this were not available. Preparation of the fields for the 1987/88 wheat crop, which will be sown between May and August or September, has so far not been as intense as in previous years.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Formosa_Television	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Formosa,_Argentina	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dutch_Formosa	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Formosa,_Goiás	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Clorinda,_Formosa	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Republic_of_Formosa	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Governor_of_Formosa	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Swainsona_formosa	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Otites_formosa	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ric_Formosa	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Urophora_formosa	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Santa_Maria_Formosa	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Formosa_Plastics_Group	http://dbpedia.org/resource/National_Formosa_University	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Lambertia_formosa	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Spanish_Formosa	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ria_Formosa	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dicentra_formosa	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Seguenzia_formosa	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Aquilegia_formosa
House Budget Committees	123	146	http://dbpedia.org/resource/United_States_House_Committee_on_the_Budget	Office of Management and Budget Director James Miller said President Reagan will reject the tax increase called for in the House Budget Committees 1988 budget proposal which is before the House for a vote today. Its just completely unacceptable, Miller told a House Appropriations subcommittee on Treasury, Postal Service and General Government Appropriations. The plan, drafted by the Democratic-controlled Budget committee, calls for 22 billion dlrs in higher revenues, of which 18 billion would be from new taxes set by the tax-writing committees. The House committees budget proposal includes some increases in federal user fees as well as 18 billion dlrs in taxes. Miller warned that failure to reduce the federal deficit would jeopardize the U.S. economy. If we do not further reduce the deficit... we place this economic expansion that weve had in the last five years at risk, Miller told the subcommittee. The result of any kind of tax increase would be to increase substantially the prospects that the expansion would come to an end, Miller said.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/United_States_House_of_Representatives	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Advisory_Committee_on_Antarctic_Names	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Village_development_committee	http://dbpedia.org/resource/House_of_Commons_of_the_United_Kingdom	http://dbpedia.org/resource/House_music	http://dbpedia.org/resource/White_House	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Random_House	http://dbpedia.org/resource/House_of_Lords	http://dbpedia.org/resource/House	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Manor_house	http://dbpedia.org/resource/House_of_Commons_of_England	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pennsylvania_House_of_Representatives	http://dbpedia.org/resource/House_of_Representatives_of_the_Philippines	http://dbpedia.org/resource/International_Olympic_Committee	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Washington_House_of_Representatives	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Carriage_house	http://dbpedia.org/resource/UK_Antarctic_Place-Names_Committee	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Massachusetts_House_of_Representatives	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ohio_House_of_Representatives	http://dbpedia.org/resource/I-house

R. Foster Winans	409	425	http://dbpedia.org/resource/R._Foster_Winans	Securities and Exchange Commission John Shad said he wanted Congress to write a better definition of insider trading but thought action should wait until the Supreme Court ruled on an insider trading case. Id like the benefit of the Winans decision before deciding on a definition, Shad told a Senate Appropriations subcommittee hearing. Shad was refering to the appeal by former Wall Street Journal reporter R. Foster Winans of his conviction on insider trading charges for telling a friend in advance what stocks he was going to write about in his column. The stocks usually went up or down in price depending on Winans recommendation. He said insider trading accounted for only 11 percent of the SECs enforcement activities last year despite the publicity given to recent major cases. Insider trading makes up only a tiny fraction of one pct of the 50 billion dlrs of daily securities trading, Shad said. Shad asked for a budget increase so the SEC could enlarge its enforcement staff by 20 this year and 73 next year to deal with all types of securities fraud. Shad said he hoped to start his new duties as U.S. Ambassador to the Netherlands by June. He said he did not know when his successor would be named by President Reagan.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/David_Foster	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Foster_care	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Stephen_Foster	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Jodie_Foster	http://dbpedia.org/resource/David_Foster_Wallace	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Alan_Dean_Foster	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Warren_Foster	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mario_Winans	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Foster_and_Partners	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Preston_Foster	http://dbpedia.org/resource/John_Foster_Dulles	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Radney_Foster	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Frank_Foster_(musician)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/CeCe_Winans	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Fred_Foster	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Al_Foster	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Lewis_R._Foster	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Foster_City,_California	http://dbpedia.org/resource/BeBe_Winans	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Foster_Wheeler

CME	1321	1324	http://dbpedia.org/resource/CME_Group	The Chicago Mercantile Exchange, CME, said it has added a new chief compliance officer and will expand its regulatory surveillance program. Paul OKelly, currently assistant regional administrator of the Securities and Exchange Commission, was named vice-president of compliance for the exchange, the CME said. The expanded compliance program, which calls for an increase in the exchanges compliance budget and addition of staff, was in response to recent criticisms that the CMEs current surveillance was not able to keep up with increased demands of recent volatility and volume, the CME said. The new surveillance program calls for the addition of three floor investigators and five compliance investigators, the CME said. Some of the new staff will monitor the exchanges new Computerized Trade Reconstruction system, scheduled to start July 1. In addition, three computer programmers will be added to assist in regulatory support for the exchanges management information system department. Recent criticism has been especially directed at the CMEs Standard and Poors stock index futures and options division. A special membership referendum to prohibit CME members from filling customer orders and trading for their own account in S and P 500 futures and options will be voted on April 13. In a letter dated March 12, CME chairman John Sandner and Executive committee chairman Leo Melamed urged members to reject the referendum in favor a series of new rules. Included in the rule changes was the requirement that futures brokers in the S and P pit manually record all personal trades to the nearest minute, intended to enhance the effectiveness of surveillance and compliance functions, We made a promise to our members that we have kept, Melamed said in a release today. He said the new surveillance program represents a commitment to a vigorous enforcement policy.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/CME_Group_Tour_Championship	http://dbpedia.org/resource/2013_CME_Group_Titleholders	http://dbpedia.org/resource/2015_CME_Group_Tour_Championship	http://dbpedia.org/resource/CME_SPAN	http://dbpedia.org/resource/2012_CME_Group_Titleholders	http://dbpedia.org/resource/2011_CME_Group_Titleholders	http://dbpedia.org/resource/2014_CME_Group_Tour_Championship	http://dbpedia.org/resource/2016_CME_Group_Tour_Championship	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Phillips_Chapel_CME_Church

Texacos	265	272	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Chevron_Corporation	First Boston Corp analyst William Randol recommended the purchase of Texaco Inc today, saying the discount that investors have made in the share price to reflect the ongoing litigation with Pennzoil has been overdone relative to how we expect the case to conclude. Texacos stock rose 1/8 to 34-1/8. On Monday, the stock tumbled four points after the Supreme Court overturned a lower court decision that cut Texacos bond in the 10.3 billion dlr legal dispute with Pennzoil Co PZL to one billion dlrs. Yesterday, a Texas court granted a temporary injunction on the bond issue pending a hearing next week. The current litigation arose from Texacos buyout of Getty Oil Co in 1984. Pennzoil sued, arguing its earlier agreement to buy Getty was binding. Two Texas state courts upheld Pennzoils position. Randol, noting that the stock has suffered a great deal in the two years since the litigation was filed, said we recognize the legal problems but think investors have overdone it. He said the stock is selling at 48 pct of its asset value, and we think it represents a good value at this level.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Fernando_Meirelles	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Nikolai_Sychov	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Self-defeating_prophecy	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Italian_declaration_of_war_on_the_United_States	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Lalitha_Mahal	http://dbpedia.org/resource/National_Police_of_Niger	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Christ_the_King_Church,_Shenzhen	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hanan_Yoran	http://dbpedia.org/resource/SLC38A2	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Wigan_by-election,_1958	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ian_Crewes	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Holy_Cross_Church,_Binstead	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Gipuzkoa_(Spanish_Congress_electoral_district)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Lorenza_Guerrieri	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Smerinthus	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Valeria_Richards	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Daewoo_FX212_Super_Cruiser	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sourp_Stepanos_Church,_Larnaca	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thailand_at_the_Paralympics	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Eilendorf_(Aachen)

Reagan	69	75	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ronald_Reagan	Office of Management and Budget Director James Miller said President Reagan will reject the tax increase called for in the House Budget Committees 1988 budget proposal which is before the House for a vote today. Its just completely unacceptable, Miller told a House Appropriations subcommittee on Treasury, Postal Service and General Government Appropriations. The plan, drafted by the Democratic-controlled Budget committee, calls for 22 billion dlrs in higher revenues, of which 18 billion would be from new taxes set by the tax-writing committees. The House committees budget proposal includes some increases in federal user fees as well as 18 billion dlrs in taxes. Miller warned that failure to reduce the federal deficit would jeopardize the U.S. economy. If we do not further reduce the deficit... we place this economic expansion that weve had in the last five years at risk, Miller told the subcommittee. The result of any kind of tax increase would be to increase substantially the prospects that the expansion would come to an end, Miller said.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Nancy_Reagan	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Presidency_of_Ronald_Reagan	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ronald_Reagan_Washington_National_Airport	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Reagan_Youth	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ronald_Reagan_Presidential_Library	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ronald_Reagan_UCLA_Medical_Center	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Michael_Reagan	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ron_Reagan	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Reagan_Doctrine	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Attempted_assassination_of_Ronald_Reagan	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Reagan_County,_Texas	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Maureen_Reagan	http://dbpedia.org/resource/List_of_federal_judges_appointed_by_Ronald_Reagan	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ronald_Reagan_in_music	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Reagan_Pasternak	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ronald_Reagan_filmography	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ronald_Reagan_Ballistic_Missile_Defense_Test_Site	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ronald_Reagan_Cross_County_Highway	http://dbpedia.org/resource/The_Reagans	http://dbpedia.org/resource/USS_Ronald_Reagan
Basra	48	53	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Basra	Iran decided to continue its operations east of Basra to destroy Iraqs forces, Iranian Prime Minister Mir-Hossein Mousavi told Tehran Radio. That seems to be the best spot for the complete destruction of (Iraqi President) Saddams forces. This is why it was decided that the operations would forcefully continue there, he said. At the same time, we have maintained our ability to act throughout the length of the fronts, Mousavi told the radio, monitored by the British Broadcasting Corporation. Tehran Radio reported over 1,500 Iraqi casualties today as Iran continued its Karbala-8 operation launched early yesterday. Iran said over 2,600 Iraqis had been killed or wounded yesterday. Iraq said today its forces had beaten back the latest attacks inflicting heavy casualties. Mousavi told Tehran radio that on the whole, our advances have broken the back of the military forces of Saddam. Earlier today the Iranian news agency IRNA said Tehrans forces were stabilising new positions after their assault on Iraqi lines defending Basra, Iraqs second city. In Baghdad, a military spokesman said Iraqi warplanes today destroyed an oil pumping station and a production unit at Irans Ahvaz field.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Basra_Governorate	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Asif_Basra	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Basra_International_Airport	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hasan_of_Basra	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Basra_Memorial	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Geeta_Basra	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Basra_governorate_election,_2009	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Basra_Vilayet	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Al-Hariri_of_Basra	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Battle_of_Basra_(2008)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Basra_Eyalet	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Timeline_of_Basra	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Basra_War_Cemetery	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Riaz_Basra	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Basra,_Morocco	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Basra_(2008_film)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Battle_of_Basra_(2003)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Battle_of_Basra_(1914)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Basra_Sports_City	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Basra_(album)

Murdochville	115	127	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Murdochville,_Quebec	Quebec mines minister Raymond Savoie said the province is prepared to offer money to help re-open (Noranda Inc))'s Murdochville, Quebec copper mine, shut down by fire last week, but said he could not give a specific figure until damage estimates have been completed. Federal member of parliament for the region,  Charles-Eugene Marin, said last week the federal government is also prepared to provide financial help to restart operations as soon as possible. Noranda has estimated damage from the fire at about 10 mln dlrs and a company spokesman said it should have a more specific estimate by the end of the month. Noranda said it had hoped to have an estimate sooner, but has found that it will take longer than expected to gain access to the burned-out area. Noranda said the mine was not insured.  said the mine was not insured. "We decided many years ago...that the costs of insuring all of NorandaNoranda's underground operations would have been prohibitive, underground operations would have been prohibitive," Larry Taylor, NorandaNoranda's risk management and insurance director, said. Taylor said before last week said before last week's fire, the company had only had one previous mine accident many years ago. Last weeks fire, the company had only had one previous mine accident many years ago. Last week's fire killed one miner and trapped 52 other underground, some for up to 24 hours. It was believed to have started on a new conveyor system. Noranda has said it would take four to five months to return the mine to normal operating capacity. It produced 72,0000 tons of copper anode last year, Coffin said. Reuter	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Murdochville_strike
J.P. Morgan and Co Inc	0	22	http://dbpedia.org/resource/J._P._Morgan	J.P. Morgan and Co Inc said its first-quarter earnings fell by 3.2 pct, largely reflecting its previously announced decision to place on non-accrual status its 1.3 billion dlrs of medium- and long-term loans to Brazil. That decision, spurred by Brazils suspension of interest payments on February 20, reduced the quarters net income by 20 mln dlrs to 226.4 mln dlrs, compared with 233.9 mln in the first three months of 1986. Morgan also reported a loss of 1.8 mln dlrs from securities underwriting and trading, in contrast to a gain of 45.4 mln dlrs in the year-earlier period. In the fourth quarter of 1986, Morgan posted other trading losses of 5.5 mln dlrs because of setbacks in the trading and underwriting of Euromarket securities. Conditions in some sectors of the Euromarket remained difficult last quarter, with floating rate notes suffering heavy price falls, but a spokeswoman was unable to say whether Morgans trading losses were restricted to the Euromarket. On the positive side, Morgan reduced its provision for loan losses to 35 mln dlrs from 70 mln a year earlier. Foreign exchange trading income rose to 82 mln dlrs from 72.6 mln and trust income increased to 95.9 mln dlrs from 75.9 mln. Morgan said other operating income, mainly fees and commissions, rose to 102.2 mln dlrs from 88.4 mln, but net investment securities gains dropped to 43.1 mln from 58.1 mln. Net interest earnings were 490.4 mln dlrs in the first quarter, down from 499.4 mln a year earlier, and net yield fell to 2.79 pct from 3.20 pct. If Brazil had not been placed on non-accrual, which means that interest can be recorded as income only when payments are actually received, net interest earnings would have been 525.9 mln dlrs and net yield 2.99 pct. If Brazil does not resume payments, 1987 net would be cut by 72 mln dlrs, Morgan added. After the provision for loan losses, Morgans allowance for credit losses at the end of March totaled 953 mln dlrs compared with 910 mln at end-1986 and 815 mln a year earlier. It reported net recoveries of six mln dlrs after charge-offs of eight mln, compared with net charge-offs of 49 mln dlrs after recoveries of three mln a year earlier. Excluding Brazil, non-accruing loans at quarters end were 583 mln dlrs, down from 633 mln at end-1986 and 684 mln a year earlier. Non-interest expenses rose to 371.1 mln dlrs from 303.5 mln dlrs, with more than half the increase related to personnel costs, Morgan said.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bosnia_and_Herzegovina	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Track_and_field	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Newfoundland_and_Labrador	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Trinidad_and_Tobago	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Provinces_and_territories_of_Canada	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Municipalities_of_Bosnia_and_Herzegovina	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Castile_and_León	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Rock_and_roll	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sistan_and_Baluchestan_Province	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Rhythm_and_blues	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Jammu_and_Kashmir	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Food_and_Drug_Administration	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Kohgiluyeh_and_Boyer-Ahmad_Province	http://dbpedia.org/resource/United_Kingdom_of_Great_Britain_and_Ireland	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Federation_of_Bosnia_and_Herzegovina	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Promotion_and_relegation	http://dbpedia.org/resource/St._John's,_Newfoundland_and_Labrador	http://dbpedia.org/resource/London_and_North_Eastern_Railway	http://dbpedia.org/resource/A-side_and_B-side	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Victoria_and_Albert_Museum

Tokyo	1960	1965	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tokyo	Senior Japanese officials tomorrow open talks with American trade negotiators in a last-ditch effort to avert new high U.S. tariffs to be imposed on a wide variety of Japanese electronic exports. Makoto Kuroda, vice minister of Japans Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI), is to hold two days of meetings with the Deputy U.S. Trade Representative, Michael Smith, and the Under Secretary of Commerce, Bruce Smart. The new tariffs, to go into effect on April 17, are in retaliation for Japans failure to adhere to an agreement to end dumping semiconductors in world markets at below cost and to open its home market to U.S. semiconductor shipments. They are to be imposed on goods which use semiconductors, including television and audio equipment and computers. Both U.S. and Japanese officials have said there was little likelihood the talks would do anything to avert the 100 pct duties on 300 mln dlrs worth of Japanese shipments. President Reagan announced the planned tariffs on March 27 after he said that close monitoring of the July 1986 U.S.-Japanese semiconductor pact convinced U.S. officials that Japan was not honoring the agreement. In making the annoucement, Reagan said I am committed to the full enforcement of our trade agreements designed to provide American industry with free and fair trade. Trade analysts said his move was aimed as much at Japans semiconductor trade practices, which are said to have injured the U.S. semiconductor industry, as Congress, which has complained about presidential timidity on trade issues. Congressional Democrats have pledged to enact aggressive trade laws to counter what they contend has been Reagans inaction to redress the growing U.S. trade deficit, which last year reached 169.8 billion dlrs. About one-third of the deficit was with Japan. Reagan said there were recent signs Japan was beginning to adhere to the pact and that was why he was not terminating it. Kuroda said on leaving Tokyo today he had no new proposals but did have an explanation of the semiconductor situation. He told the daily newspaper Ashai Shimbun that Reagans decision was based on inaccurate data and an exaggerated sense of MITIs power to control Japanese traders. The United States has excessive expectations., he said. To stabilize supply-demand relations which have been disrupted by excess inventories since 1985 will take some time. He also said that U.S. firms had not been aggressive enough in trying to sell in the Japanese market.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/TV_Tokyo	http://dbpedia.org/resource/University_of_Tokyo	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tokyo_Broadcasting_System	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Chiyoda,_Tokyo	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tokyo_Verdy	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Minato,_Tokyo	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tokyo_Station	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tokyo_Bay	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tokyo_Metro	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ōta,_Tokyo	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tokyo_Dome	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Chūō,_Tokyo	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tokyo_Yakult_Swallows	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hachiōji,_Tokyo	http://dbpedia.org/resource/FC_Tokyo	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tokyo_International_Film_Festival	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tokyo_Stock_Exchange	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tokyo_Metropolitan_Television	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tokyo_Disneyland	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Adachi,_Tokyo
Reuters Holdings Plc	168	188	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Reuters	Exchanges and telecommunications authorities should abolish their restrictions on full and free dissemination of information to the investment and banking communities, Reuters Holdings Plc RTRS.L chairman Sir Christopher Hogg said. In the 1986 annual repoprt, he said lengthy negotiations had brought agreement with the Tokyo and London Stock Exchanges for fuller, but still not complete, access to market data through Reuter services. Many other markets maintain restrictions, he added. Hogg said members of some markets appear to believe that information restrictions protected their interests. In other cases, exchanges seem to be limiting the distribution of data in order to provide competitive advantage to their own commercial information businesses. He also noted that despite increasing liberalisation in the telecommunications field, some countries continue to protect their state monopolies at the expense of other economic sectors. Reuter dealing services remain excluded from such countries. As a result, banking communities serving entire economies are put at a competitive disadvantage, he added. Reuters increased its 1986 pre-tax profit by 39 pct from the previous year to 130.1 mln stg on a 43 pct rise in revenues to 620.9 mln stg. Earnings per ordinary share were up 47 pct to 19.4p.

Treasury	2	10	http://dbpedia.org/resource/United_States_Department_of_the_Treasury	A Treasury official said there are no plans to try to reduce the U.S. budget deficit by issuing yen-denominated bonds that would become known as Reagan bonds. It simply isnt something that we are planning to do, the official said. He added the Treasury was aware of Japanese news reports suggesting the Reagan administration might issue such bonds as the former Carter administration did when it sold Carter bonds denominated in West German marks. But he said the situation was greatly different now. If you look at the differences between the treasury market now and in the Carter administration years, it is a much more global market now, the official said. There was not the same ease then for the holder of another currency to buy other countries securities, he added, But there is no difficulty now for them to purchase dollars and buy U.S. securities. The United States needs dollars, not Japanese yen, to pay its debts and reduce the deficit and so has no plans to issue yen-denominated bonds, he emphasized.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/United_States_Secretary_of_the_Treasury	http://dbpedia.org/resource/HM_Treasury	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Treasury	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Department_of_the_Treasury_(Australia)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/United_States_Treasury_security	http://dbpedia.org/resource/First_Lord_of_the_Treasury	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Master_of_the_treasury	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Financial_Secretary_to_the_Treasury	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Solicitor_of_the_United_States_Treasury	http://dbpedia.org/resource/State_Treasury	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Treasury_Board	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Overseer_of_the_treasuries	http://dbpedia.org/resource/United_States_Assistant_Secretary_of_the_Treasury	http://dbpedia.org/resource/New_Zealand_Treasury	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Treasury_Islands	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Secretary_to_the_Treasury	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Register_of_the_Treasury	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Parliamentary_Secretary_to_the_Treasury	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Comptroller_of_the_Treasury	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Treasury_stock
Santa Fe	1722	1730	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Santa_Fe_Province	Argentine grain producers adjusted their yield estimates for the 1986/87 coarse grain crop downward in the week to yesterday after the heavy rains at the end of March and beginning of April, trade sources said. They said sunflower, maize and sorghum production estimates had been reduced despite some later warm, dry weather, which has allowed a return to harvesting in some areas. However, as showers fell intermittently after last weekend, producers feared another spell of prolonged and intense rain could cause more damage to crops already badly hit this season. Rains in the middle of last week reached an average of 27 millimetres in parts of Buenos Aires province, 83 mm in Cordoba, 41 in Santa Fe, 50 in Entre Rios and Misiones, 95 in Corrientes, eight in Chaco and 35 in Formosa. There was no rainfall in the same period in La Pampa. Producers feared continued damp conditions could produce rotting and lead to still lower yield estimates for all the crops, including soybean. However, as the lands began drying later in the week harvesting advanced considerably, reaching between 36 and 40 pct of the area sown in the case of sunflower. Deterioration of the sunflower crop evident in harvested material in Cordoba, La Pampa and Buenos Aires forced yield estimates per hectare to be adjusted down again. The seasons sunflowerseed production is now forecast at 2.1 mln to 2.3 mln tonnes, against 2.2 mln to 2.4 mln forecast last week and down 43.9 to 48.8 pct on the 1985/86 record of 4.1 mln. Area sown to sunflowers was two to 2.2 mln hectares, 29.9 to 36.3 pct below the record 3.14 mln hectares last season. Maize harvesting has also reached 36 to 40 pct of the area sown. It is near completion in Cordoba and Santa Fe and will begin in La Pampa and southern Buenos Aires later in April. Production estimates for maize were down from last week at 9.5 mln to 9.8 mln tonnes, against 9.6 mln to 9.9 mln estimated previously. This is 22.2 to 23.4 pct below the 12.4 mln to 12.6 mln tonnes estimated by private sources for the 1985/86 crop and 21.9 to 25.8 pct down on the official figure of 12.8 mln tonnes. Maize was sown on 3.58 mln to 3.78 mln hectares, two to seven pct down on last seasons 3.85 mln. Sorghum was harvested on 23 to 25 pct of the area sown in Cordoba, Santa Fe and Chaco. Harvest will start in La Pampa and Buenos Aires in mid-April. The total area sown was 1.23 mln to 1.30 mln hectares, 10.3 to 15.2 pct down on the 1.45 mln sown last season. The new forecast for the sorghum crop is 2.9 mln to 3.2 mln tonnes compared with three mln to 3.3 mln forecast last week, and is 23.8 to 29.3 pct down on last seasons 4.1 mln to 4.2 mln tonne crop. The soybean crop for this season was not adjusted, remaining at a record 7.5 mln to 7.7 mln tonnes, up 4.2 to 5.5 pct on the 7.2 mln to 7.3 mln estimated by private sources for 1985/86 and 5.6 to 8.5 pct higher than the official figure of 7.1 mln. The area sown to soybeans this season was a record 3.7 mln to 3.8 mln hectares, 10.8 to 13.8 pct up on the record 3.34 mln sown in 1985/86. The soybean crop is showing excessive moisture in some areas and producers fear they may discover more damage. Some experimental harvesting was carried out in Santa Fe on areas making up only about one pct of the total crop but details on this were not available. Preparation of the fields for the 1987/88 wheat crop, which will be sown between May and August or September, has so far not been as intense as in previous years.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Santa_Fe,_New_Mexico	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Santa_Catarina_(state)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Santa_Barbara,_California	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Santa_Monica,_California	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Santa_Fe,_Argentina	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Santa_Claus	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Rosario,_Santa_Fe	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Santa_Cruz,_California	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Santa_Clara,_California	http://dbpedia.org/resource/St._John's_College_(Annapolis/Santa_Fe)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/University_of_California,_Santa_Barbara	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Santa_Clara_University	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Santa_Ana,_California	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Atchison,_Topeka_and_Santa_Fe_Railway	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Santa_Rosa,_California	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Santa_Fe_Trail	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Unión_de_Santa_Fe	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Independiente_Santa_Fe	http://dbpedia.org/resource/University_of_California,_Santa_Cruz	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Santa_Cruz_de_la_Sierra
Reagan	1226	1232	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ronald_Reagan	Securities and Exchange Commission John Shad said he wanted Congress to write a better definition of insider trading but thought action should wait until the Supreme Court ruled on an insider trading case. Id like the benefit of the Winans decision before deciding on a definition, Shad told a Senate Appropriations subcommittee hearing. Shad was refering to the appeal by former Wall Street Journal reporter R. Foster Winans of his conviction on insider trading charges for telling a friend in advance what stocks he was going to write about in his column. The stocks usually went up or down in price depending on Winans recommendation. He said insider trading accounted for only 11 percent of the SECs enforcement activities last year despite the publicity given to recent major cases. Insider trading makes up only a tiny fraction of one pct of the 50 billion dlrs of daily securities trading, Shad said. Shad asked for a budget increase so the SEC could enlarge its enforcement staff by 20 this year and 73 next year to deal with all types of securities fraud. Shad said he hoped to start his new duties as U.S. Ambassador to the Netherlands by June.

Paul OKelly, currently assistant regional administrator of the Securities and Exchange Commission, was named vice-president of compliance for the exchange, the CME said. The expanded compliance program, which calls for an increase in the exchanges compliance budget and addition of staff, was in response to recent criticisms that the CMEs current surveillance was not able to keep up with increased demands of recent volatility and volume, the CME said. The new surveillance program calls for the addition of three floor investigators and five compliance investigators, the CME said. Some of the new staff will monitor the exchanges new Computerized Trade Reconstruction system, scheduled to start July 1. In addition, three computer programmers will be added to assist in regulatory support for the exchanges management information system department. Recent criticism has been especially directed at the CMEs Standard and Poors stock index futures and options division. A special membership referendum to prohibit CME members from filling customer orders and trading for their own account in S and P 500 futures and options will be voted on April 13. In a letter dated March 12, CME chairman John Sandner and Executive committee chairman Leo Melamed urged members to reject the referendum in favor a series of new rules. Included in the rule changes was the requirement that futures brokers in the S and P pit manually record all personal trades to the nearest minute, intended to enhance the effectiveness of surveillance and compliance functions, We made a promise to our members that we have kept, Melamed said in a release today. He said the new surveillance program represents a commitment to a vigorous enforcement policy.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Leo_Tolstoy	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pope_Leo_XIII	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pope_Leo_X	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Leo_(constellation)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Leo_Robin	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Josh_Leo	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Leo_Kottke	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Leo_Awards	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Leo_Sayer	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Leo_White	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Melissa_Leo	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Leo_Brouwer	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Leo_Carrillo	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Leo_Strauss	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Leo_(astrology)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pope_Leo_XII	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Leo_Ku	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Leo_Minor	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Leo_Tover	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Leo_Durocher

U.S. Senate Budget Committee	4	32	http://dbpedia.org/resource/United_States_Senate_Committee_on_the_Budget	The U.S. Senate Budget Committee ended its stalemate over a budget plan and approved by a single vote a revised 1988 budget proposed by chairman Lawton Chiles to cut the deficit to 133.7 billion next year. The new plan broke last week to cut the deficit to 133.7 billion next year. The new plan broke last week's gridlock in which the committee failed to approve a similar Chiles plan on a tie vote. Today, the measure was sent to the Senate 13 to 11. Among a series of changes to get the extra vote, Chiles added about 400 mln dlrs for additional, unspecified, agricultural spending programs to be paid with partly with higher user fees.

Charles-Eugene Marin	313	333	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Charles-Eugène_Marin	Quebec mines minister Raymond Savoie said the province is prepared to offer money to help re-open (Noranda Inc))'s Murdochville, Quebec copper mine, shut down by fire last week, but said he could not give a specific figure until damage estimates have been completed. Federal member of parliament for the region,  Charles-Eugene Marin, said last week the federal government is also prepared to provide financial help to restart operations as soon as possible. Noranda has estimated damage from the fire at about 10 mln dlrs and a company spokesman said it should have a more specific estimate by the end of the month. Noranda said it had hoped to have an estimate sooner, but has found that it will take longer than expected to gain access to the burned-out area. Noranda said the mine was not insured.  said the mine was not insured. "We decided many years ago...that the costs of insuring all of NorandaNoranda's underground operations would have been prohibitive, underground operations would have been prohibitive," Larry Taylor, NorandaNoranda's risk management and insurance director, said. Taylor said before last week said before last week's fire, the company had only had one previous mine accident many years ago. Last weeks fire, the company had only had one previous mine accident many years ago. Last week's fire killed one miner and trapped 52 other underground, some for up to 24 hours. It was believed to have started on a new conveyor system. Noranda has said it would take four to five months to return the mine to normal operating capacity. It produced 72,0000 tons of copper anode last year, Coffin said.

Georgia	414	421	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Georgia_Power	An audit submitted to the Georgia Public Service Commission claims that between 944 mln dlrs and 1.8 billion dlrs of the costs of the Plant Vogtle nuclear power station should be disallowed, a Southern Co spokeswoman said. Southerns Georgia Power Co subsidiary has a 45.7 pct interest in the plant and estimated earlier this year it would cost a total of 8.87 billion dlrs. Last year, the plants owners pledged to Georgia regulators they would limit the cost passed on to rate payers to 8.4 billion dlrs. The Southern spokeswoman said the company feels the report by OBrien-Kreitzberg is flawed and biased. She said the report was released yesterday by the state attorney general. Responding to the report today, Georgia Power Chairman Robert W. Scherer told a news conference the conclusions drawn by the firm are not only wrong -- they also reflect the same bias against nuclear power that these auditors have demonstrated in similar cases accross the country. Saying he was not suggesting Georgia power was without fault, Scherer said the audit identified several things I wish we had done differently. Scherer pointed out a report OBrien-Kreitzberg submitted to Georgia regulators in March 1986 projected Georgia Power would not finish Plant Vogtle unit one before the end of 1987. Noting unit one is finished, and we expect it to be in commercial operationg by June, he said the firms latest report ignored the earlier projection, gave the utility no credit for the completion and actually penalized us by suggesting that costs to maintain t he schedule be disallowed. Scherer said the latest audit alleges Georgia Power could have saved 95 mln dlrs if it had stopped using four shifts, seven days a week to speed construction three years sooner. He said this would have delayed completion of the plant for another year and it would have cost several hunderd million dlrs more. Noting the audit said costs were increased 600 mln dlrs by schedule delays totaling 20.5 months, he said First, we have the best concrete placement record in the industry, Second new government regulations after the Three Mile Island incident significantly increased construction time.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Georgia_(country)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Georgia_(U.S._state)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Savannah,_Georgia	http://dbpedia.org/resource/University_of_Georgia	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Athens,_Georgia	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Macon,_Georgia	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Augusta,_Georgia	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Columbus,_Georgia	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Georgia_Institute_of_Technology	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Marietta,_Georgia	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Georgia_House_of_Representatives	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Albany,_Georgia	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Decatur,_Georgia	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Rome,_Georgia	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Georgia_State_University	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Georgia_Bulldogs_football	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Valdosta,_Georgia	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Gainesville,_Georgia	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Georgia_Dome	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Brunswick,_Georgia
U.S. Trade Representative	336	361	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Office_of_the_United_States_Trade_Representative	Senior Japanese officials tomorrow open talks with American trade negotiators in a last-ditch effort to avert new high U.S. tariffs to be imposed on a wide variety of Japanese electronic exports. Makoto Kuroda, vice minister of Japans Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI), is to hold two days of meetings with the Deputy U.S. Trade Representative, Michael Smith, and the Under Secretary of Commerce, Bruce Smart. The new tariffs, to go into effect on April 17, are in retaliation for Japans failure to adhere to an agreement to end dumping semiconductors in world markets at below cost and to open its home market to U.S. semiconductor shipments. They are to be imposed on goods which use semiconductors, including television and audio equipment and computers. Both U.S. and Japanese officials have said there was little likelihood the talks would do anything to avert the 100 pct duties on 300 mln dlrs worth of Japanese shipments. President Reagan announced the planned tariffs on March 27 after he said that close monitoring of the July 1986 U.S.-Japanese semiconductor pact convinced U.S. officials that Japan was not honoring the agreement. In making the annoucement, Reagan said I am committed to the full enforcement of our trade agreements designed to provide American industry with free and fair trade. Trade analysts said his move was aimed as much at Japans semiconductor trade practices, which are said to have injured the U.S. semiconductor industry, as Congress, which has complained about presidential timidity on trade issues. Congressional Democrats have pledged to enact aggressive trade laws to counter what they contend has been Reagans inaction to redress the growing U.S. trade deficit, which last year reached 169.8 billion dlrs. About one-third of the deficit was with Japan. Reagan said there were recent signs Japan was beginning to adhere to the pact and that was why he was not terminating it. Kuroda said on leaving Tokyo today he had no new proposals but did have an explanation of the semiconductor situation. He told the daily newspaper Ashai Shimbun that Reagans decision was based on inaccurate data and an exaggerated sense of MITIs power to control Japanese traders. The United States has excessive expectations., he said. To stabilize supply-demand relations which have been disrupted by excess inventories since 1985 will take some time. He also said that U.S. firms had not been aggressive enough in trying to sell in the Japanese market.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/United_States_House_of_Representatives	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Trade_union	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pennsylvania_House_of_Representatives	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Washington_House_of_Representatives	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Massachusetts_House_of_Representatives	http://dbpedia.org/resource/House_of_Representatives_of_the_Philippines	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ohio_House_of_Representatives	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Trade	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Trade_association	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Florida_House_of_Representatives	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Illinois_House_of_Representatives	http://dbpedia.org/resource/List_of_Otago_representative_cricketers	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Iowa_House_of_Representatives	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Minnesota_House_of_Representatives	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Missouri_House_of_Representatives	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Kansas_House_of_Representatives	http://dbpedia.org/resource/List_of_Auckland_representative_cricketers	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Georgia_House_of_Representatives	http://dbpedia.org/resource/List_of_Tasmanian_representative_cricketers	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Michigan_House_of_Representatives
