Ivory Coast	1516	1527	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ivory_Coast	Major cocoa exporters are likely to limit sales in the weeks ahead in an effort to boost world prices, sources close to a meeting of the Cocoa Producers Alliance (CPA) said. The sources said the depressed world market had been one of the main topics discussed in a closed door meeting of the 11-member CPA which began on Monday. They said producers agreed that cutting sales would aid the buffer stock manager of a new international cocoa pact in his effort to support prices. Major cocoa producing and consuming nations agreed operation rules for the buffer stock at a meeting in London last month and the stock manager is expected to enter the market soon. Prices, under the weight of three successive cocoa surpluses, recently fell to the level at which the manager has to buy cocoa under stock rules. The buffer stock aims to keep prices within a pre-set range by buying when prices fall and selling when they rise. The worlds cocoa price at present is just not interesting, commented one delegate representing a major CPA producer. Another source said that with much of the 1986/87 (October-September) world cocoa crop sold, limiting sales in the near term concerns essentially next years harvest. The sources noted, however, that the cocoa industry in Brazil, the worlds number two producer, is in private hands. This means limiting sales is more difficult than in major West African producers, where sales are made or authorized by commodity marketing boards. The CPA includes the worlds top three producers, Ivory Coast, Brazil and Ghana, and accounts for 80 pct of all output. The meeting here is due to end tomorrow evening.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Big_Hill,_Victoria_(Surf_Coast_Shire)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/West_Coast_Express_(ice_hockey)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/George_V_Coast	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Japan_Coast_Guard	http://dbpedia.org/resource/2014–15_West_Coast_Conference_women's_basketball_season	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Kamala,_Ivory_Coast	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Coast_Guard_Station_Menemsha	http://dbpedia.org/resource/High_Coast	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Range_3_Coast_Land_District	http://dbpedia.org/resource/South_Coast_Radio
Franklin	1160	1168	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Franklin,_Tennessee	Promising new findings in the use of a controversial experimental drug called Interleukin-2 as a cure for cancer will be published in the April 9 issue of the prestigious New England Journal of Medicine, according to a Wall Street analyst who has obtained an advance copy of the magazine. Among interleukins principal U. S. makers are Cetus Corp CTUS, headquartered in Emeryville, Calif., and Immunex Corp IMNX, based in Seattle, Wash. The journal, to be released late today, contains two articles reporting high remission rates several cancer types. The journal also contains a signed editorial concluding that the new results mark a significant milestone in the search for a successful immunotherapy for cancer. Interleukin-2, also known as IL-2, is a substance naturally produced by living cells in the laboratory. The drug is controversial because it was widely praised as a promising cancer treatment in early reports on its effectiveness in late 1985, only to come under criticism a year later for its failure to live up to its promise and due to its ravaging side effects. One of the new studies, conducted by Dr. William West of Biotherapeutics Inc of Franklin, Tenn., is particularly significant because it found far fewer harsh side effects after it changed the way in which the drug is administered. In that study, researchers administered IL-2 to 48 cancer patients and found a 50-pct remission rate for kidney cancers and a 50 pct remission rate for melanoma, a type of skin cancer, according to Prudential-Bache Securities Stuart Weisbrod, who obtained the advance copy of the magazine. For rectal and colon cancer, the researchers found no remissions, but none of the 48 patients treated had side effects serious enough to be placed under intensive hospital care, according to the article. In the second study, whose principal author is Dr. Steven Rosenberg of the National Cancer Institute, researchers administered IL-2 to 157 cancer patients and found a 33 pct remission rate in cancers of the kidney, a 27 pct rate in melanomas and a 15 pct rate in cancers of the colon and rectum. In the National Cancer Institute trials, a total of four patients died, the magazine reported, confirming the harshness of the drugs side effects as originally administered. Perhaps we are at the end of the beginning of the search for successful immunotherapy for cancer, said the editorial, signed by John Durant of Philadelphias Chase Cancer Center. These observations reported by Rosenberg and West surely did not describe successful practical approaches ready for widespread applications in the therapy of cancer patients, the editorial said. On the other hand, if they reflect, as seems possible, a successful manipulation of the cellular immune system, then we may be near the end of our search for a meaningful direction in the immunuotherapy of cancer, the editorial concluded.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/New_Franklin,_Stark_County,_Ohio	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Franklin_County_Government_Center	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Franklin_Booth	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bob_Franklin_(comedian)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Franklin_Canyon_Park	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Franklin_Bay	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Franklin_Landers-Black_and_Adams_Farm	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Upper_North_Franklin_Street_Commercial_District	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Jethro_Franklin	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Franklin_Glacier_Volcano
Chicago Mercantile Exchange	4	31	http://dbpedia.org/resource/CME_Group	The Chicago Mercantile Exchange, CME, said it has added a new chief compliance officer and will expand its regulatory surveillance program. Paul OKelly, currently assistant regional administrator of the Securities and Exchange Commission, was named vice-president of compliance for the exchange, the CME said. The expanded compliance program, which calls for an increase in the exchanges compliance budget and addition of staff, was in response to recent criticisms that the CMEs current surveillance was not able to keep up with increased demands of recent volatility and volume, the CME said. The new surveillance program calls for the addition of three floor investigators and five compliance investigators, the CME said. Some of the new staff will monitor the exchanges new Computerized Trade Reconstruction system, scheduled to start July 1. In addition, three computer programmers will be added to assist in regulatory support for the exchanges management information system department. Recent criticism has been especially directed at the CMEs Standard and Poors stock index futures and options division. A special membership referendum to prohibit CME members from filling customer orders and trading for their own account in S and P 500 futures and options will be voted on April 13. In a letter dated March 12, CME chairman John Sandner and Executive committee chairman Leo Melamed urged members to reject the referendum in favor a series of new rules. Included in the rule changes was the requirement that futures brokers in the S and P pit manually record all personal trades to the nearest minute, intended to enhance the effectiveness of surveillance and compliance functions, We made a promise to our members that we have kept, Melamed said in a release today. He said the new surveillance program represents a commitment to a vigorous enforcement policy.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/2017_Chicago_White_Sox_season	http://dbpedia.org/resource/2011_Chicago_Bears_season	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Chicago,_Milwaukee_and_St._Paul_Freight_House	http://dbpedia.org/resource/2010_Chicago_Bears_season	http://dbpedia.org/resource/The_Columbian_Exchange	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dunning,_Chicago	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Chicago_(Prison_Break)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Lists_of_companies_listed_on_the_Toronto_Stock_Exchange	http://dbpedia.org/resource/2012_Chicago_Slaughter_season	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Chicago_film_industry

Carter	401	407	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Jimmy_Carter	A Treasury official said there are no plans to try to reduce the U.S. budget deficit by issuing yen-denominated bonds that would become known as Reagan bonds. It simply isnt something that we are planning to do, the official said. He added the Treasury was aware of Japanese news reports suggesting the Reagan administration might issue such bonds as the former Carter administration did when it sold Carter bonds denominated in West German marks. But he said the situation was greatly different now. If you look at the differences between the treasury market now and in the Carter administration years, it is a much more global market now, the official said. There was not the same ease then for the holder of another currency to buy other countries securities, he added, But there is no difficulty now for them to purchase dollars and buy U.S. securities. The United States needs dollars, not Japanese yen, to pay its debts and reduce the deficit and so has no plans to issue yen-denominated bonds, he emphasized.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/I_Fell_in_Love_(Carlene_Carter_song)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Nigel_Carter	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Reginald_Carter_(politician)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Gary_Carter	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ken_Carter_(song)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Samuel_Carter_(Canadian_politician)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Catharine_Carter_Critcher	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thomas_Henry_Carter_(soldier)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Louise_Carter	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Asa_Earl_Carter

Burlington	805	815	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Burlington_Industries	The largest U.S. textile maker focused on its own business as its competitors found merger partners, but now Burlington Industries Inc may have restructured itself into an attractive takeover candidate, analysts said. The takeover spotlight fell today on Burlington, which rose 4-7/8 to 52-7/8 on speculation that investor Asher Edelman and Dominion Textiles Inc of Canada bought an almost five pct stake. A published report said Edelman and Dominion jointly acquired a stake in Burlington and were weighing a takeover offer. Edelman would not comment, and a spokesman for Montreal-based Dominion called the report just rumors. Burlington said it did not know if the report was true. Wall Street professionals said they were not convinced of the story or that Edelman and Dominion would be the victors if Burlington actually came into play. Arbitragers said past comments from Dominion, however, added credence to the speculation. Dominion has said that it was looking for a takeover in the U.S. Last year, Dominion unsuccessfully bid for Avondale Mills and has maintained a 120 mln dlr line of credit to be used for a U.S. acquisition. A Dominion spokesman said Canadas largest textile producer has been negotiating with many U.S. textile companies, but would not say whether Burlington was among them. There have been acquisitions in this area. Its not unusual that someone could be looking at Burlington after the housecleaning theyve done, said Eileen Gormley of Thomson McKinnon. Burlington sold its domestic operations, which made sheets and other linens, to J.P. Stevens and Co Inc for 110 mln dlrs last year. It also has reorganized management, and focused its operations on businesses that would be less affected by foreign competition, Gormley said. Theyve pulled back so as not to be a commodity marketer, said Gormley. She said in moving more heavily into industrial fabrics, Burlington bought C.H. Masland, which supplies carpets and other fabric to the auto industry. In the past, they just spent and never realized the return on the outlays they did make, she said.

Burlington	628	638	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dominion_Textile	The largest U.S. textile maker focused on its own business as its competitors found merger partners, but now Burlington Industries Inc may have restructured itself into an attractive takeover candidate, analysts said. The takeover spotlight fell today on Burlington, which rose 4-7/8 to 52-7/8 on speculation that investor Asher Edelman and Dominion Textiles Inc of Canada bought an almost five pct stake. A published report said Edelman and Dominion jointly acquired a stake in Burlington and were weighing a takeover offer. Edelman would not comment, and a spokesman for Montreal-based Dominion called the report just rumors. Burlington said it did not know if the report was true. Wall Street professionals said they were not convinced of the story or that Edelman and Dominion would be the victors if Burlington actually came into play. Arbitragers said past comments from Dominion, however, added credence to the speculation. Dominion has said that it was looking for a takeover in the U.S. Last year, Dominion unsuccessfully bid for Avondale Mills and has maintained a 120 mln dlr line of credit to be used for a U.S. acquisition. A Dominion spokesman said Canadas largest textile producer has been negotiating with many U.S. textile companies, but would not say whether Burlington was among them. There have been acquisitions in this area. Its not unusual that someone could be looking at Burlington after the housecleaning theyve done, said Eileen Gormley of Thomson McKinnon. Burlington sold its domestic operations, which made sheets and other linens, to J.P. Stevens and Co Inc for 110 mln dlrs last year. It also has reorganized management, and focused its operations on businesses that would be less affected by foreign competition, Gormley said. Theyve pulled back so as not to be a commodity marketer, said Gormley. She said in moving more heavily into industrial fabrics, Burlington bought C.H. Masland, which supplies carpets and other fabric to the auto industry. In the past, they just spent and never realized the return on the outlays they did make, she said. You look at their record over the year, and I think theyre poised to be more profitable than they had been in the past, Gormley said.

Duponts Conoco Incs	4374	4393	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Conoco	Cheap oil feedstocks, the weakened U.S. dollar and a plant utilization rate approaching 90 pct will propel the streamlined U.S. petrochemical industry to record profits this year, with growth expected through at least 1990, major company executives predicted. This bullish outlook for chemical manufacturing and an industrywide move to shed unrelated businesses has prompted GAF Corp (GAF), privately-held Cain Chemical Inc, and other firms to aggressively seek acquisitions of petrochemical plants. Oil companies such as Ashland Oil Inc (ASH), the Kentucky-based oil refiner and marketer, are also shopping for money-making petrochemical businesses to buy. I see us poised at the threshold of a golden period, said Paul Oreffice, chairman of giant Dow Chemical Co (DOW), adding, Theres no major plant capacity being added around the world now. The whole game is bringing out new products and improving the old ones. Analysts say the chemical industrys biggest customers, automobile manufacturers and home builders that use a lot of paints and plastics, are expected to buy quantities this year. U.S. petrochemical plants are currently operating at about 90 pct capacity, reflecting tighter supply that could hike product prices by 30 to 40 pct this year, said John Dosher, managing director of Pace Consultants Inc of Houston. Demand for some products such as styrene could push profit margins up by as much as 300 pct, he said. Oreffice, speaking at a meeting of chemical engineers in Houston, said Dow would easily top the 741 mln dlrs it earned last year and predicted it would have the best year in its history. In 1985, when oil prices were still above 25 dlrs a barrel and chemical exports were adversely affected by the strong U.S. dollar, Dow had profits of 58 mln dlrs. I believe the entire chemical industry is headed for a record year or close to it, Oreffice said. GAF chairman Samuel Heyman estimated that the U.S. chemical industry would report a 20 pct gain in profits during 1987. Last year, the domestic industry earned a total of 13 billion dlrs, a 54 pct leap from 1985. The turn in the fortunes of the once-sickly chemical industry has been brought about by a combination of luck and planning, said Paces John Dosher. Dosher said last years fall in oil prices made feedstocks dramatically cheaper and at the same time the American dollar was weakening against foreign currencies. That helped boost U.S. chemical exports. Also helping to bring supply and demand into balance has been the gradual market absorption of the extra chemical manufacturing capacity created by Middle Eastern oil producers in the early 1980s. Finally, virtually all major U.S. chemical manufacturers have embarked on an extensive corporate restructuring program to mothball inefficient plants, trim the payroll and eliminate unrelated businesses. The restructuring touched off a flurry of friendly and hostile takeover attempts. GAF, which made an unsuccessful attempt in 1985 to acquire Union Carbide Corp UK, recently offered three billion dlrs for Borg Warner Corp BOR, a Chicago manufacturer of plastics and chemicals. Another industry powerhouse, W.R. Grace (GRA) has divested its retailing, restaurant and fertilizer businesses to raise cash for chemical acquisitions. But some experts worry that the chemical industry may be headed for trouble if companies continue turning their back on the manufacturing of staple petrochemical commodities, such as ethylene, in favor of more profitable specialty chemicals that are custom-designed for a small group of buyers. Companies like DuPont (DD) and Monsanto Co MTC spent the past two or three years trying to get out of the commodity chemical business in reaction to how badly the market had deteriorated, Dosher said. But I think they will eventually kill the margins on the profitable chemicals in the niche market. Some top chemical executives share the concern. The challenge for our industry is to keep from getting carried away and repeating past mistakes, GAFs Heyman cautioned. The shift from commodity chemicals may be ill-advised. Specialty businesses do not stay special long. Houston-based Cain Chemical, created this month by the Sterling investment banking group, believes it can generate 700 mln dlrs in annual sales by bucking the industry trend. Chairman Gordon Cain, who previously led a leveraged buyout of Duponts Conoco Incs chemical business, has spent 1.1 billion dlrs since January to buy seven petrochemical plants along the Texas Gulf Coast. The plants produce only basic commodity petrochemicals that are the building blocks of specialty products. This kind of commodity chemical business will never be a glamorous, high-margin business, Cain said, adding that demand is expected to grow by about three pct annually. Garo Armen, an analyst with Dean Witter Reynolds, said chemical makers have also benefitted by increasing demand for plastics as prices become more competitive with aluminum, wood and steel products. Armen estimated the upturn in the chemical business could last as long as four or five years, provided the U.S. economy continues its modest rate of growth.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Prise_de_parole_Inc_v_Guérin,_éditeur_Ltée	http://dbpedia.org/resource/UFJ_Holdings,_Inc.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Playboy_Enterprises,_Inc._v._Netscape_Communications_Corp.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Interlego_AG_v_Tyco_Industries_Inc	http://dbpedia.org/resource/MeritHall_Inc	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bammert_v._Don's_Super_Valu,_Inc.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Lansdale_Silk_Hosiery_Compy-Interstate_Hosiery_Mills,_Inc.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Peace_and_Love,_Inc.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Coherent,_Inc.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/ApothéCure_Inc.

Saouma	549	555	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Edouard_Saouma	World output of staple foods maintained growth in 1986, following a record harvest the year before, and most of the increase was in developing countries, the director general of the U.N.s Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) said. Speaking to FAOs committee on world food security, Edouard Saouma said sub-Saharan Africa registered a cereal production increase of 3.6 pct in 1986 and the Far East also continued to increase production. Despite ample supplies worldwide, many countries face problems in paying for all the food they need, he said. Saouma said many of the developing worlds food problems were the result of chaotic world trade. He said it was vital to promote employment to improve the food-security situation of the poor, with policy reforms in developing countries to remove existing disincentives to production so that agriculture could play a greater role in stimulating economic growth.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ruslan_Spirin_(athlete)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hügelkultur	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Helen_Milligan_(chess_player)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/PraxisUnico	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Rebecca_Eisenberg	http://dbpedia.org/resource/David_Island	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Satpakhali	http://dbpedia.org/resource/106th_Signal_Brigade_(United_States)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Antietam,_Maryland	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Magical_Canan
U.K	795	798	http://dbpedia.org/resource/United_Kingdom	Britain intends to negotiate further agreements on international securities regulation to match those now in force with the U.S. And Japan, government sources said. The Department of Trade and Industry said earlier it had concluded a memorandum of understanding with Japans Finance Ministry to swap supervisory and investigatory information. The agreement covers stocks, shares and government bonds, but not commodity futures, whose regulation in Japan does not come under the Finance Ministry. It therefore does not cover some transactions on the London International Financial Futures Exchange and the London commodities and metal exchanges. The DTI said it hoped to seek further understandings with other countries which met in the U.K. Last December. The meeting involved delegates from the U.K., Switzerland, the U.S., Canada, Australia, Hong Kong, Japan, France, West Germany and Holland. Government sources said the deal with Japan completes arrangements linking Tokyo, the U.S. And London. A U.K. Agreement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) was signed last September. Todays agreement will deal with requests for information on a case by case basis, U.K. Government sources said.

At the same time, we have maintained our ability to act throughout the length of the fronts, Mousavi told the radio, monitored by the British Broadcasting Corporation. Tehran Radio reported over 1,500 Iraqi casualties today as Iran continued its Karbala-8 operation launched early yesterday. Iran said over 2,600 Iraqis had been killed or wounded yesterday. Iraq said today its forces had beaten back the latest attacks inflicting heavy casualties. Mousavi told Tehran radio that on the whole, our advances have broken the back of the military forces of Saddam. Earlier today the Iranian news agency IRNA said Tehrans forces were stabilising new positions after their assault on Iraqi lines defending Basra, Iraqs second city.

The Department of Trade and Industry said earlier it had concluded a memorandum of understanding with Japans Finance Ministry to swap supervisory and investigatory information. The agreement covers stocks, shares and government bonds, but not commodity futures, whose regulation in Japan does not come under the Finance Ministry. It therefore does not cover some transactions on the London International Financial Futures Exchange and the London commodities and metal exchanges. The DTI said it hoped to seek further understandings with other countries which met in the U.K. Last December. The meeting involved delegates from the U.K., Switzerland, the U.S., Canada, Australia, Hong Kong, Japan, France, West Germany and Holland. Government sources said the deal with Japan completes arrangements linking Tokyo, the U.S. And London. A U.K. Agreement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) was signed last September. Todays agreement will deal with requests for information on a case by case basis, U.K. Government sources said. It is not legally binding and comes into force immediately.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Fatal_Care:_Survive_in_the_U.S._Health_System	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Spring_Styles_books_(U.S._Navy)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thatch_Cay,_U.S._Virgin_Islands	http://dbpedia.org/resource/'Til_Death_Do_Us_Part_(U.S._TV_series)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/2013_U.S._National_Indoor_Tennis_Championships_–_Women's_Singles	http://dbpedia.org/resource/U.S._Route_6_in_Iowa	http://dbpedia.org/resource/2016–17_U.S._Sassuolo_Calcio_season	http://dbpedia.org/resource/List_of_legislative_committees_of_Georgia_(U.S._state)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/1935_U.S._Open_(golf)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/U.S._Route_44

Pennzoil Co	463	474	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pennzoil	First Boston Corp analyst William Randol recommended the purchase of Texaco Inc today, saying the discount that investors have made in the share price to reflect the ongoing litigation with Pennzoil has been overdone relative to how we expect the case to conclude. Texacos stock rose 1/8 to 34-1/8. On Monday, the stock tumbled four points after the Supreme Court overturned a lower court decision that cut Texacos bond in the 10.3 billion dlr legal dispute with Pennzoil Co PZL to one billion dlrs. Yesterday, a Texas court granted a temporary injunction on the bond issue pending a hearing next week. The current litigation arose from Texacos buyout of Getty Oil Co in 1984. Pennzoil sued, arguing its earlier agreement to buy Getty was binding. Two Texas state courts upheld Pennzoils position. Randol, noting that the stock has suffered a great deal in the two years since the litigation was filed, said we recognize the legal problems but think investors have overdone it. He said the stock is selling at 48 pct of its asset value, and we think it represents a good value at this level.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Aspect_Co.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Gould_Estate_v_Stoddart_Publishing_Co_Ltd	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Stalky_&_Co.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/South_Suburban_Co-operative_Society	http://dbpedia.org/resource/United_Steelworkers_v_Warrior_&_Gulf_Navigation_Co	http://dbpedia.org/resource/S.H._Kress_&_Co._Building_(Nogales,_Arizona)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hancocks_&_Co	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bayford_&_Co	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Moulton_Co-operative_Society	http://dbpedia.org/resource/NLRB_v._Mackay_Radio_&_Telegraph_Co.

International Monetary Fund	434	461	http://dbpedia.org/resource/International_Monetary_Fund	The Zambian government has no immediate plans to follow last weeks increase in the producer price of maize with a hike in the retail price of maize meal, an official of the ruling party said. Last December, a 120 pct increase in the consumer price for refined maize meal, a Zambian staple, led to food riots in which at least 15 people died. That price increase, which President Kenneth Kaunda later revoked, followed pressure by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to reduce the governments subsidy bill. However, if the producer price rise, from 6.10 dlrs to 8.67 dlrs per 90-kg bag, is not accompanied by a retail price increase, the government will have to spend more on subsidies, a practice discouraged by the IMF. There is no way out but to raise the subsidy levels of meal. It (the government) would have to choose between the demands of the IMF and those of the people, a Ministry of Agriculture economist said.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Jakarta_International_College	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cosmetics_International	http://dbpedia.org/resource/60th_Berlin_International_Film_Festival	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tripoli_International_Airport	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Don_Mueang_International_Airport	http://dbpedia.org/resource/1962_International_Cross_Country_Championships	http://dbpedia.org/resource/International_Ministerial_Council_of_Great_Britain	http://dbpedia.org/resource/DMC_International_Imaging	http://dbpedia.org/resource/International_rankings_of_Singapore	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Big_Shoulders_Fund

U.K	735	738	http://dbpedia.org/resource/United_Kingdom	Britain intends to negotiate further agreements on international securities regulation to match those now in force with the U.S. And Japan, government sources said. The Department of Trade and Industry said earlier it had concluded a memorandum of understanding with Japans Finance Ministry to swap supervisory and investigatory information. The agreement covers stocks, shares and government bonds, but not commodity futures, whose regulation in Japan does not come under the Finance Ministry. It therefore does not cover some transactions on the London International Financial Futures Exchange and the London commodities and metal exchanges. The DTI said it hoped to seek further understandings with other countries which met in the U.K. Last December. The meeting involved delegates from the U.K., Switzerland, the U.S., Canada, Australia, Hong Kong, Japan, France, West Germany and Holland. Government sources said the deal with Japan completes arrangements linking Tokyo, the U.S. And London. A U.K. Agreement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) was signed last September. Todays agreement will deal with requests for information on a case by case basis, U.K. Government sources said. It is not legally binding and comes into force immediately.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/The_40th_Anniversary_Tour_of_the_U.K.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Gyosei_International_College_in_the_U.K.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Back_in_the_U.K.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/U.K._(band)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Munde_U.K._De	http://dbpedia.org/resource/U.K._Remixes	http://dbpedia.org/resource/List_of_Prime_Suspect_(U.K._TV_series)_episodes	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Taipei_Representative_Office_in_the_U.K.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Coptic_Orthodox_Diocese_of_the_Midlands_and_Affiliated_Areas_U.K.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/U.K._(album)

Ahvaz	1178	1183	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ahvaz	Iran decided to continue its operations east of Basra to destroy Iraqs forces, Iranian Prime Minister Mir-Hossein Mousavi told Tehran Radio. That seems to be the best spot for the complete destruction of (Iraqi President) Saddams forces. This is why it was decided that the operations would forcefully continue there, he said. At the same time, we have maintained our ability to act throughout the length of the fronts, Mousavi told the radio, monitored by the British Broadcasting Corporation. Tehran Radio reported over 1,500 Iraqi casualties today as Iran continued its Karbala-8 operation launched early yesterday. Iran said over 2,600 Iraqis had been killed or wounded yesterday. Iraq said today its forces had beaten back the latest attacks inflicting heavy casualties. Mousavi told Tehran radio that on the whole, our advances have broken the back of the military forces of Saddam. Earlier today the Iranian news agency IRNA said Tehrans forces were stabilising new positions after their assault on Iraqi lines defending Basra, Iraqs second city. In Baghdad, a military spokesman said Iraqi warplanes today destroyed an oil pumping station and a production unit at Irans Ahvaz field.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hammad,_Ahvaz	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Yobareh,_Ahvaz	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Faculty_of_Pharmacy,_Ahvaz_Jundishapur_University_of_Medical_Sciences	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Takhti_Stadium_(Ahvaz)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Shahrak-e_Azadi,_Ahvaz	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Horriyeh,_Ahvaz	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Esteghlal_Ahvaz_F.C.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Seyyed_Amer,_Ahvaz	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tall_Asvad,_Ahvaz	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Central_District_(Ahvaz_County)

Boeing	799	805	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Boeing	Faulty repair work by The Boeing Company BA.N was a contributary cause to a Japan Air Lines Co Ltd JAPN.Y 747 crash on August 12, 1985, that killed 520 people, the final draft of a Ministry of Transport report says. There were only four survivors when the aircraft crashed into a mountain north of Tokyo. The report said inadequate inspection of the aircraft by Japanese inspectors after the repairs was another factor in the crash. The crew were cleared of any responsibility for the disaster. The report, which was sent on March 23 to the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board for comment, should be released in late May. Under an international convention the draft must be submitted for final comments to the relevant authorities. Boeing spokesmen were unavailable for comment. On April 4, a Boeing spokesman at the firms headquarters said the company would probably make no comment on the Japanese investigation teams report until it was officially released. On September 6, 1985, Boeing said in a statement that the 1978 repairs it had undertaken were faulty. This statement did not, however, connect the faulty repairs with the cause of the crash.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Boeing_CH-47_Chinook	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Boeing_Ground-to-Air_Pilotless_Aircraft	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Boeing_CQM-121_Pave_Tiger	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Boeing_Model_8	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Accidents_and_incidents_involving_the_Boeing_B-17_Flying_Fortress	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Boeing_UK	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Boeing_Vertol_YUH-61	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Boeing_Rotorcraft_Systems	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Boeing_Model_1	http://dbpedia.org/resource/1933_United_Airlines_Boeing_247_mid-air_explosion
Dominion Textile	794	810	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dominion_Textile	Dominion Textile Inc considers a published report that it has bought a stake in Burlington Industries Inc and is considering making a joint bid for the company to be a rumor, a company spokesman said. As far as I am concerned and the company is concerned, they are rumors and were not commenting on rumors, spokesman Michel Dufour told Reuters in response to a query. All the information that has been given out publicly is that, yes, Dominion Textile is interested in making an acquisition that big...probably based on that people are starting all sorts of rumors, he said. Dufour said yes when asked whether the report was only a rumor, but said the company was not prepared to comment further. Dominion Textile president and chairman Thomas Bell was out of town and unavailable for comment. Dominion Textile last year made an unsuccesful 104-mln- U.S.-dlr bid for Avondale Mills and has maintained a 120-mln- U.S.-dlr line of credit to be used for an American acquisition. Dufour said the company has been negotiating with many U.S. textile companies but would not say whether Burlington Industries was one of them. Burlingtons stock rose sharply this morning on the report, which said Dominion Textile had joined with U.S. investor Asher Edelman to buy a stake in the company and to consider making a takeover offer. Dominion Textile, which reported operating profit of 11.1 mln Canadian dlrs last year on sales of 926.5 mln dlrs, has repeatedly said it will concentrate on expanding into the U.S. The company has said it plans to diversify into new product and market areas in addition to expanding its textile operations.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/1974_Old_Dominion_500	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Gassing_(textile_process)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Portadown_Textile_Workers'_Union	http://dbpedia.org/resource/1956_Old_Dominion_400	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dominion_Automobile_Association	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dominion	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pile_(textile)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Old_Dominion,_Virginia	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dominion_(Benedictum_album)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/2015–16_Old_Dominion_Monarchs_basketball_team
London	581	587	http://dbpedia.org/resource/London	Major cocoa exporters are likely to limit sales in the weeks ahead in an effort to boost world prices, sources close to a meeting of the Cocoa Producers Alliance (CPA) said. The sources said the depressed world market had been one of the main topics discussed in a closed door meeting of the 11-member CPA which began on Monday. They said producers agreed that cutting sales would aid the buffer stock manager of a new international cocoa pact in his effort to support prices. Major cocoa producing and consuming nations agreed operation rules for the buffer stock at a meeting in London last month and the stock manager is expected to enter the market soon. Prices, under the weight of three successive cocoa surpluses, recently fell to the level at which the manager has to buy cocoa under stock rules. The buffer stock aims to keep prices within a pre-set range by buying when prices fall and selling when they rise. The worlds cocoa price at present is just not interesting, commented one delegate representing a major CPA producer. Another source said that with much of the 1986/87 (October-September) world cocoa crop sold, limiting sales in the near term concerns essentially next years harvest. The sources noted, however, that the cocoa industry in Brazil, the worlds number two producer, is in private hands. This means limiting sales is more difficult than in major West African producers, where sales are made or authorized by commodity marketing boards. The CPA includes the worlds top three producers, Ivory Coast, Brazil and Ghana, and accounts for 80 pct of all output. The meeting here is due to end tomorrow evening.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/East_London_United_F.C.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/London_Olympians	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tigers,_London_Zoological_Gardens	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Wil_London	http://dbpedia.org/resource/London_East_(European_Parliament_constituency)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Newham_London_Borough_Council_election,_1974	http://dbpedia.org/resource/List_of_Fellows_of_the_Society_of_Antiquaries_of_London	http://dbpedia.org/resource/The_London_Concert_(George_Russell_album)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Coat_of_arms_of_the_London_Borough_of_Brent	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Inner_London_Probation_Service
London Stock Exchanges	330	352	http://dbpedia.org/resource/London_Stock_Exchange	Exchanges and telecommunications authorities should abolish their restrictions on full and free dissemination of information to the investment and banking communities, Reuters Holdings Plc RTRS.L chairman Sir Christopher Hogg said. In the 1986 annual repoprt, he said lengthy negotiations had brought agreement with the Tokyo and London Stock Exchanges for fuller, but still not complete, access to market data through Reuter services. Many other markets maintain restrictions, he added. Hogg said members of some markets appear to believe that information restrictions protected their interests. In other cases, exchanges seem to be limiting the distribution of data in order to provide competitive advantage to their own commercial information businesses. He also noted that despite increasing liberalisation in the telecommunications field, some countries continue to protect their state monopolies at the expense of other economic sectors. Reuter dealing services remain excluded from such countries. As a result, banking communities serving entire economies are put at a competitive disadvantage, he added. Reuters increased its 1986 pre-tax profit by 39 pct from the previous year to 130.1 mln stg on a 43 pct rise in revenues to 620.9 mln stg. Earnings per ordinary share were up 47 pct to 19.4p.

Reuters	209	216	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Reuters	Storage problems with Brazils record grain crop are likely to result in losses of about five mln tonnes, an Agriculture Ministry spokesman said. Ministry spokesman Leonardo Brito, speaking from Brasilia, told Reuters he believed that about five mln tonnes of this years estimated crop of 65 mln tonnes would be lost. He said part of this would be the normal loss inevitable in harvesting, but that most of it would stem from storage problems. Brazil has a storage capacity of 66 mln tonnes, theoretically sufficient for the crop. But Brito said that the storage capacity was badly distributed. The states of Sao Paulo, Parana and Rio Grande do Sul had between them 70 pct of the nations capacity, but were responsible for only 50 to 60 pct of production. The biggest problems are concentrated in the Centre-West growing regions, where rising production has outpaced storage capacity. Brito said the Centre-West, whose crops include soya and maize, had between 30 and 40 pct of the nations grains production but only 20 pct of its storage space. In addition to the poor distribution of storage units, there is the problem that too much of the capacity is geared to storing grain in sacks, while not enough is suitable for storing loose grain, Brito said. Finally, there is a shortage of lorries to transport the crops. The sheer scale of the task in transporting the record crop has been evident from television reports, which have shown enormous queues of lorries waiting outside granaries.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Reuters_TV	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thomson_Reuters_Messenger	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Reuters_Market_Light	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Reuters_Group	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Calais_(Reuters_product)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Reuters_Institute_for_the_Study_of_Journalism	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thomson_Reuters_league_tables	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thomson_Reuters_Citation_Laureates	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Reuters_3000_Xtra	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Reuters_Insider
Poland	227	233	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Poland	Plans to rejuvenate Polands economy by reducing central government control would help reassure Western creditors that the countrys economy was safe to invest in, a senior Polish official said. The business of granting loans to Poland is not as bad a business as you might imagine, senior Polish government spokesman Jerzy Urban told a news conference in Stockholm. Urban, visiting the Swedish capital to deliver a lecture at the Foreign Policy Institute, announced earlier this week that Poland would soon offer shares to private citizens in state companies in a bid to make the economy more responsive. This was part of a major economic reform to be announced in the coming weeks, he said. Urban said the main problem with his countrys foreign debt burden of 32 billion dollars was short term interest charges but the long term looked more secure. He said he hoped talks under way with the Paris Club, grouping Polands main government creditors, would shortly solve the problem of short term servicing. Urban told reporters that debt servicing was hampering the expansion of the national economy, but that the new plans for economic reform would open new vistas for Polish exports. He criticised the blocking efforts of some Western governments, whom he declined to name, for putting political considerations ahead of economic co-operation. After the lifting of U.S. Sanctions against the Polish economy we considered all political obstacles had been removed, but that has not been the case, Urban said.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/2010_Bronze_Helmet_(Poland)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Kotlin,_Greater_Poland_Voivodeship	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Nuna,_Poland	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Targowisko,_Greater_Poland_Voivodeship	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Wysoka_Wielka,_Greater_Poland_Voivodeship	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Italy–Poland_relations	http://dbpedia.org/resource/List_of_massacres_in_Poland	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Przybyszów,_Greater_Poland_Voivodeship	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Przybyszewo,_Greater_Poland_Voivodeship	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Maksymilianowo,_Greater_Poland_Voivodeship
Dominion	931	939	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dominion_Textile	The largest U.S. textile maker focused on its own business as its competitors found merger partners, but now Burlington Industries Inc may have restructured itself into an attractive takeover candidate, analysts said. The takeover spotlight fell today on Burlington, which rose 4-7/8 to 52-7/8 on speculation that investor Asher Edelman and Dominion Textiles Inc of Canada bought an almost five pct stake. A published report said Edelman and Dominion jointly acquired a stake in Burlington and were weighing a takeover offer. Edelman would not comment, and a spokesman for Montreal-based Dominion called the report just rumors. Burlington said it did not know if the report was true. Wall Street professionals said they were not convinced of the story or that Edelman and Dominion would be the victors if Burlington actually came into play. Arbitragers said past comments from Dominion, however, added credence to the speculation. Dominion has said that it was looking for a takeover in the U.S. Last year, Dominion unsuccessfully bid for Avondale Mills and has maintained a 120 mln dlr line of credit to be used for a U.S. acquisition. A Dominion spokesman said Canadas largest textile producer has been negotiating with many U.S. textile companies, but would not say whether Burlington was among them. There have been acquisitions in this area. Its not unusual that someone could be looking at Burlington after the housecleaning theyve done, said Eileen Gormley of Thomson McKinnon. Burlington sold its domestic operations, which made sheets and other linens, to J.P. Stevens and Co Inc for 110 mln dlrs last year. It also has reorganized management, and focused its operations on businesses that would be less affected by foreign competition, Gormley said. Theyve pulled back so as not to be a commodity marketer, said Gormley. She said in moving more heavily into industrial fabrics, Burlington bought C.H. Masland, which supplies carpets and other fabric to the auto industry. In the past, they just spent and never realized the return on the outlays they did make, she said. You look at their record over the year, and I think theyre poised to be more profitable than they had been in the past, Gormley said. She estimated 1987 earnings of 2.50 dlrs per share, up from 2.01 dlrs per share. Some analysts today recommended clients not buy Burlington at its current levels. Edward Johnson of Johnson Redbook said he recommends selling. He said he believes the stock is worth only about 50 dlrs on a takeover basis and about 46 dlrs on an earnings basis. Some arbitragers, however, said takeover values have been placed on the company of 60 to 65 dlrs per share. After Ashers (Edelman) recent history, a lot of people dont find him very credible anymore, said one arbitrager.

Dominion	877	885	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dominion_Textile	The largest U.S. textile maker focused on its own business as its competitors found merger partners, but now Burlington Industries Inc may have restructured itself into an attractive takeover candidate, analysts said. The takeover spotlight fell today on Burlington, which rose 4-7/8 to 52-7/8 on speculation that investor Asher Edelman and Dominion Textiles Inc of Canada bought an almost five pct stake. A published report said Edelman and Dominion jointly acquired a stake in Burlington and were weighing a takeover offer. Edelman would not comment, and a spokesman for Montreal-based Dominion called the report just rumors. Burlington said it did not know if the report was true. Wall Street professionals said they were not convinced of the story or that Edelman and Dominion would be the victors if Burlington actually came into play. Arbitragers said past comments from Dominion, however, added credence to the speculation. Dominion has said that it was looking for a takeover in the U.S. Last year, Dominion unsuccessfully bid for Avondale Mills and has maintained a 120 mln dlr line of credit to be used for a U.S. acquisition. A Dominion spokesman said Canadas largest textile producer has been negotiating with many U.S. textile companies, but would not say whether Burlington was among them. There have been acquisitions in this area. Its not unusual that someone could be looking at Burlington after the housecleaning theyve done, said Eileen Gormley of Thomson McKinnon. Burlington sold its domestic operations, which made sheets and other linens, to J.P. Stevens and Co Inc for 110 mln dlrs last year. It also has reorganized management, and focused its operations on businesses that would be less affected by foreign competition, Gormley said. Theyve pulled back so as not to be a commodity marketer, said Gormley. She said in moving more heavily into industrial fabrics, Burlington bought C.H. Masland, which supplies carpets and other fabric to the auto industry. In the past, they just spent and never realized the return on the outlays they did make, she said. You look at their record over the year, and I think theyre poised to be more profitable than they had been in the past, Gormley said. She estimated 1987 earnings of 2.50 dlrs per share, up from 2.01 dlrs per share. Some analysts today recommended clients not buy Burlington at its current levels. Edward Johnson of Johnson Redbook said he recommends selling. He said he believes the stock is worth only about 50 dlrs on a takeover basis and about 46 dlrs on an earnings basis. Some arbitragers, however, said takeover values have been placed on the company of 60 to 65 dlrs per share.

CME	1156	1159	http://dbpedia.org/resource/CME_Group	The Chicago Mercantile Exchange, CME, said it has added a new chief compliance officer and will expand its regulatory surveillance program. Paul OKelly, currently assistant regional administrator of the Securities and Exchange Commission, was named vice-president of compliance for the exchange, the CME said. The expanded compliance program, which calls for an increase in the exchanges compliance budget and addition of staff, was in response to recent criticisms that the CMEs current surveillance was not able to keep up with increased demands of recent volatility and volume, the CME said. The new surveillance program calls for the addition of three floor investigators and five compliance investigators, the CME said. Some of the new staff will monitor the exchanges new Computerized Trade Reconstruction system, scheduled to start July 1. In addition, three computer programmers will be added to assist in regulatory support for the exchanges management information system department. Recent criticism has been especially directed at the CMEs Standard and Poors stock index futures and options division. A special membership referendum to prohibit CME members from filling customer orders and trading for their own account in S and P 500 futures and options will be voted on April 13. In a letter dated March 12, CME chairman John Sandner and Executive committee chairman Leo Melamed urged members to reject the referendum in favor a series of new rules. Included in the rule changes was the requirement that futures brokers in the S and P pit manually record all personal trades to the nearest minute, intended to enhance the effectiveness of surveillance and compliance functions, We made a promise to our members that we have kept, Melamed said in a release today. He said the new surveillance program represents a commitment to a vigorous enforcement policy.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/2015_CME_Group_Tour_Championship	http://dbpedia.org/resource/CME_SPAN	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Phillips_Chapel_CME_Church	http://dbpedia.org/resource/2012_CME_Group_Titleholders	http://dbpedia.org/resource/2011_CME_Group_Titleholders	http://dbpedia.org/resource/2014_CME_Group_Tour_Championship	http://dbpedia.org/resource/2016_CME_Group_Tour_Championship	http://dbpedia.org/resource/CME_Group_Tour_Championship	http://dbpedia.org/resource/2013_CME_Group_Titleholders
United States	2222	2235	http://dbpedia.org/resource/United_States	Senior Japanese officials tomorrow open talks with American trade negotiators in a last-ditch effort to avert new high U.S. tariffs to be imposed on a wide variety of Japanese electronic exports. Makoto Kuroda, vice minister of Japans Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI), is to hold two days of meetings with the Deputy U.S. Trade Representative, Michael Smith, and the Under Secretary of Commerce, Bruce Smart. The new tariffs, to go into effect on April 17, are in retaliation for Japans failure to adhere to an agreement to end dumping semiconductors in world markets at below cost and to open its home market to U.S. semiconductor shipments. They are to be imposed on goods which use semiconductors, including television and audio equipment and computers. Both U.S. and Japanese officials have said there was little likelihood the talks would do anything to avert the 100 pct duties on 300 mln dlrs worth of Japanese shipments. President Reagan announced the planned tariffs on March 27 after he said that close monitoring of the July 1986 U.S.-Japanese semiconductor pact convinced U.S. officials that Japan was not honoring the agreement. In making the annoucement, Reagan said I am committed to the full enforcement of our trade agreements designed to provide American industry with free and fair trade. Trade analysts said his move was aimed as much at Japans semiconductor trade practices, which are said to have injured the U.S. semiconductor industry, as Congress, which has complained about presidential timidity on trade issues. Congressional Democrats have pledged to enact aggressive trade laws to counter what they contend has been Reagans inaction to redress the growing U.S. trade deficit, which last year reached 169.8 billion dlrs. About one-third of the deficit was with Japan. Reagan said there were recent signs Japan was beginning to adhere to the pact and that was why he was not terminating it. Kuroda said on leaving Tokyo today he had no new proposals but did have an explanation of the semiconductor situation. He told the daily newspaper Ashai Shimbun that Reagans decision was based on inaccurate data and an exaggerated sense of MITIs power to control Japanese traders. The United States has excessive expectations., he said. To stabilize supply-demand relations which have been disrupted by excess inventories since 1985 will take some time. He also said that U.S. firms had not been aggressive enough in trying to sell in the Japanese market.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/2008–09_North_Dakota_State_Bison_men's_basketball_team	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Michigan_State_Fair_Riding_Coliseum,_Dairy_Cattle_Building,_and_Agricultural_Building	http://dbpedia.org/resource/2014_United_Supercup	http://dbpedia.org/resource/United_States_presidential_election,_1852	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Persistent_vegetative_state	http://dbpedia.org/resource/United_States_Army_Remount_Service	http://dbpedia.org/resource/North_Hero_State_Park	http://dbpedia.org/resource/United_States_presidential_election_in_California,_1984	http://dbpedia.org/resource/United_States_Senate_election_in_Oklahoma,_2008	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Lifespan_timeline_of_heads_of_state_of_Romania
Chaco	764	769	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Chaco_Province	Argentine grain producers adjusted their yield estimates for the 1986/87 coarse grain crop downward in the week to yesterday after the heavy rains at the end of March and beginning of April, trade sources said. They said sunflower, maize and sorghum production estimates had been reduced despite some later warm, dry weather, which has allowed a return to harvesting in some areas. However, as showers fell intermittently after last weekend, producers feared another spell of prolonged and intense rain could cause more damage to crops already badly hit this season. Rains in the middle of last week reached an average of 27 millimetres in parts of Buenos Aires province, 83 mm in Cordoba, 41 in Santa Fe, 50 in Entre Rios and Misiones, 95 in Corrientes, eight in Chaco and 35 in Formosa. There was no rainfall in the same period in La Pampa. Producers feared continued damp conditions could produce rotting and lead to still lower yield estimates for all the crops, including soybean. However, as the lands began drying later in the week harvesting advanced considerably, reaching between 36 and 40 pct of the area sown in the case of sunflower. Deterioration of the sunflower crop evident in harvested material in Cordoba, La Pampa and Buenos Aires forced yield estimates per hectare to be adjusted down again. The seasons sunflowerseed production is now forecast at 2.1 mln to 2.3 mln tonnes, against 2.2 mln to 2.4 mln forecast last week and down 43.9 to 48.8 pct on the 1985/86 record of 4.1 mln. Area sown to sunflowers was two to 2.2 mln hectares, 29.9 to 36.3 pct below the record 3.14 mln hectares last season. Maize harvesting has also reached 36 to 40 pct of the area sown. It is near completion in Cordoba and Santa Fe and will begin in La Pampa and southern Buenos Aires later in April. Production estimates for maize were down from last week at 9.5 mln to 9.8 mln tonnes, against 9.6 mln to 9.9 mln estimated previously. This is 22.2 to 23.4 pct below the 12.4 mln to 12.6 mln tonnes estimated by private sources for the 1985/86 crop and 21.9 to 25.8 pct down on the official figure of 12.8 mln tonnes. Maize was sown on 3.58 mln to 3.78 mln hectares, two to seven pct down on last seasons 3.85 mln. Sorghum was harvested on 23 to 25 pct of the area sown in Cordoba, Santa Fe and Chaco. Harvest will start in La Pampa and Buenos Aires in mid-April. The total area sown was 1.23 mln to 1.30 mln hectares, 10.3 to 15.2 pct down on the 1.45 mln sown last season. The new forecast for the sorghum crop is 2.9 mln to 3.2 mln tonnes compared with three mln to 3.3 mln forecast last week, and is 23.8 to 29.3 pct down on last seasons 4.1 mln to 4.2 mln tonne crop. The soybean crop for this season was not adjusted, remaining at a record 7.5 mln to 7.7 mln tonnes, up 4.2 to 5.5 pct on the 7.2 mln to 7.3 mln estimated by private sources for 1985/86 and 5.6 to 8.5 pct higher than the official figure of 7.1 mln. The area sown to soybeans this season was a record 3.7 mln to 3.8 mln hectares, 10.8 to 13.8 pct up on the record 3.34 mln sown in 1985/86. The soybean crop is showing excessive moisture in some areas and producers fear they may discover more damage. Some experimental harvesting was carried out in Santa Fe on areas making up only about one pct of the total crop but details on this were not available. Preparation of the fields for the 1987/88 wheat crop, which will be sown between May and August or September, has so far not been as intense as in previous years.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Miraflores,_Chaco	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Paraje_San_Fernando,_Chaco	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Servicios_Ferroviarios_del_Chaco	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Juan_José_Castelli,_Chaco	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Chaco_tucumana	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Aerial_operations_in_the_Chaco_War	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Estadio_Defensores_del_Chaco	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Nueve_de_Julio_Department,_Chaco	http://dbpedia.org/resource/San_Bernardo,_Chaco	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Libertad_Department,_Chaco
Samuel Heyman	1891	1904	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Samuel_J._Heyman	Cheap oil feedstocks, the weakened U.S. dollar and a plant utilization rate approaching 90 pct will propel the streamlined U.S. petrochemical industry to record profits this year, with growth expected through at least 1990, major company executives predicted. This bullish outlook for chemical manufacturing and an industrywide move to shed unrelated businesses has prompted GAF Corp (GAF), privately-held Cain Chemical Inc, and other firms to aggressively seek acquisitions of petrochemical plants. Oil companies such as Ashland Oil Inc (ASH), the Kentucky-based oil refiner and marketer, are also shopping for money-making petrochemical businesses to buy. I see us poised at the threshold of a golden period, said Paul Oreffice, chairman of giant Dow Chemical Co (DOW), adding, Theres no major plant capacity being added around the world now. The whole game is bringing out new products and improving the old ones. Analysts say the chemical industrys biggest customers, automobile manufacturers and home builders that use a lot of paints and plastics, are expected to buy quantities this year. U.S. petrochemical plants are currently operating at about 90 pct capacity, reflecting tighter supply that could hike product prices by 30 to 40 pct this year, said John Dosher, managing director of Pace Consultants Inc of Houston. Demand for some products such as styrene could push profit margins up by as much as 300 pct, he said. Oreffice, speaking at a meeting of chemical engineers in Houston, said Dow would easily top the 741 mln dlrs it earned last year and predicted it would have the best year in its history. In 1985, when oil prices were still above 25 dlrs a barrel and chemical exports were adversely affected by the strong U.S. dollar, Dow had profits of 58 mln dlrs. I believe the entire chemical industry is headed for a record year or close to it, Oreffice said. GAF chairman Samuel Heyman estimated that the U.S. chemical industry would report a 20 pct gain in profits during 1987. Last year, the domestic industry earned a total of 13 billion dlrs, a 54 pct leap from 1985. The turn in the fortunes of the once-sickly chemical industry has been brought about by a combination of luck and planning, said Paces John Dosher. Dosher said last years fall in oil prices made feedstocks dramatically cheaper and at the same time the American dollar was weakening against foreign currencies. That helped boost U.S. chemical exports. Also helping to bring supply and demand into balance has been the gradual market absorption of the extra chemical manufacturing capacity created by Middle Eastern oil producers in the early 1980s. Finally, virtually all major U.S. chemical manufacturers have embarked on an extensive corporate restructuring program to mothball inefficient plants, trim the payroll and eliminate unrelated businesses. The restructuring touched off a flurry of friendly and hostile takeover attempts. GAF, which made an unsuccessful attempt in 1985 to acquire Union Carbide Corp UK, recently offered three billion dlrs for Borg Warner Corp BOR, a Chicago manufacturer of plastics and chemicals. Another industry powerhouse, W.R. Grace (GRA) has divested its retailing, restaurant and fertilizer businesses to raise cash for chemical acquisitions. But some experts worry that the chemical industry may be headed for trouble if companies continue turning their back on the manufacturing of staple petrochemical commodities, such as ethylene, in favor of more profitable specialty chemicals that are custom-designed for a small group of buyers. Companies like DuPont (DD) and Monsanto Co MTC spent the past two or three years trying to get out of the commodity chemical business in reaction to how badly the market had deteriorated, Dosher said. But I think they will eventually kill the margins on the profitable chemicals in the niche market. Some top chemical executives share the concern. The challenge for our industry is to keep from getting carried away and repeating past mistakes, GAFs Heyman cautioned. The shift from commodity chemicals may be ill-advised. Specialty businesses do not stay special long. Houston-based Cain Chemical, created this month by the Sterling investment banking group, believes it can generate 700 mln dlrs in annual sales by bucking the industry trend. Chairman Gordon Cain, who previously led a leveraged buyout of Duponts Conoco Incs chemical business, has spent 1.1 billion dlrs since January to buy seven petrochemical plants along the Texas Gulf Coast. The plants produce only basic commodity petrochemicals that are the building blocks of specialty products. This kind of commodity chemical business will never be a glamorous, high-margin business, Cain said, adding that demand is expected to grow by about three pct annually. Garo Armen, an analyst with Dean Witter Reynolds, said chemical makers have also benefitted by increasing demand for plastics as prices become more competitive with aluminum, wood and steel products. Armen estimated the upturn in the chemical business could last as long as four or five years, provided the U.S. economy continues its modest rate of growth.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Samuel_R._Williamson,_Jr.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Samuel_Suba	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Samuel_Cheetham_(footballer)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Samuel_H._Frost	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Khari_Samuel	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Samuel_Bourn_the_Younger	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Samuel_Bell_Thomas	http://dbpedia.org/resource/The_Table_Talk_of_Samuel_Marchbanks	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Assembe_Ndoum_Samuel_Wilfried	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Samuel_Seabury_(bishop)

Tokyo	298	303	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tokyo	Faulty repair work by The Boeing Company BA.N was a contributary cause to a Japan Air Lines Co Ltd JAPN.Y 747 crash on August 12, 1985, that killed 520 people, the final draft of a Ministry of Transport report says. There were only four survivors when the aircraft crashed into a mountain north of Tokyo. The report said inadequate inspection of the aircraft by Japanese inspectors after the repairs was another factor in the crash. The crew were cleared of any responsibility for the disaster. The report, which was sent on March 23 to the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board for comment, should be released in late May. Under an international convention the draft must be submitted for final comments to the relevant authorities. Boeing spokesmen were unavailable for comment. On April 4, a Boeing spokesman at the firms headquarters said the company would probably make no comment on the Japanese investigation teams report until it was officially released. On September 6, 1985, Boeing said in a statement that the 1978 repairs it had undertaken were faulty. This statement did not, however, connect the faulty repairs with the cause of the crash.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Minami-Azabu,_Minato,_Tokyo	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Asia/Tokyo	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Kabukichō,_Tokyo	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tokyo_Idol_Festival	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tokyo_Nichi_Nichi_Shimbun	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Canadian_International_School_(Tokyo)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mermaid_Lagoon_(Tokyo_DisneySea)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/List_of_Tokyo_DisneySea_attractions	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tokyo_Global_Concert	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tokyo_Disneyland_Electrical_Parade_Dreamlights_~Christmas~
Wall Street	219	230	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Wall_Street	Promising new findings in the use of a controversial experimental drug called Interleukin-2 as a cure for cancer will be published in the April 9 issue of the prestigious New England Journal of Medicine, according to a Wall Street analyst who has obtained an advance copy of the magazine. Among interleukins principal U. S. makers are Cetus Corp CTUS, headquartered in Emeryville, Calif., and Immunex Corp IMNX, based in Seattle, Wash. The journal, to be released late today, contains two articles reporting high remission rates several cancer types. The journal also contains a signed editorial concluding that the new results mark a significant milestone in the search for a successful immunotherapy for cancer. Interleukin-2, also known as IL-2, is a substance naturally produced by living cells in the laboratory. The drug is controversial because it was widely praised as a promising cancer treatment in early reports on its effectiveness in late 1985, only to come under criticism a year later for its failure to live up to its promise and due to its ravaging side effects. One of the new studies, conducted by Dr. William West of Biotherapeutics Inc of Franklin, Tenn., is particularly significant because it found far fewer harsh side effects after it changed the way in which the drug is administered. In that study, researchers administered IL-2 to 48 cancer patients and found a 50-pct remission rate for kidney cancers and a 50 pct remission rate for melanoma, a type of skin cancer, according to Prudential-Bache Securities Stuart Weisbrod, who obtained the advance copy of the magazine. For rectal and colon cancer, the researchers found no remissions, but none of the 48 patients treated had side effects serious enough to be placed under intensive hospital care, according to the article. In the second study, whose principal author is Dr. Steven Rosenberg of the National Cancer Institute, researchers administered IL-2 to 157 cancer patients and found a 33 pct remission rate in cancers of the kidney, a 27 pct rate in melanomas and a 15 pct rate in cancers of the colon and rectum. In the National Cancer Institute trials, a total of four patients died, the magazine reported, confirming the harshness of the drugs side effects as originally administered. Perhaps we are at the end of the beginning of the search for successful immunotherapy for cancer, said the editorial, signed by John Durant of Philadelphias Chase Cancer Center. These observations reported by Rosenberg and West surely did not describe successful practical approaches ready for widespread applications in the therapy of cancer patients, the editorial said. On the other hand, if they reflect, as seems possible, a successful manipulation of the cellular immune system, then we may be near the end of our search for a meaningful direction in the immunuotherapy of cancer, the editorial concluded.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Travis_Wall	http://dbpedia.org/resource/58th_Street_Terminal_(IRT_Sixth_Avenue_Line)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Banbury_Merton_Street_railway_station	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Barton_Street_(Hamilton,_Ontario)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/List_of_streets_in_Buriram	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Adams_Street_Double_House	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pleasant_Street_Firehouse	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Main_Street_Historic_District_(Cold_Spring_Harbor,_New_York)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Wall_Recordings	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Reed_Street_Historic_District

Dominion Textile	1321	1337	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dominion_Textile	Dominion Textile Inc considers a published report that it has bought a stake in Burlington Industries Inc and is considering making a joint bid for the company to be a rumor, a company spokesman said. As far as I am concerned and the company is concerned, they are rumors and were not commenting on rumors, spokesman Michel Dufour told Reuters in response to a query. All the information that has been given out publicly is that, yes, Dominion Textile is interested in making an acquisition that big...probably based on that people are starting all sorts of rumors, he said. Dufour said yes when asked whether the report was only a rumor, but said the company was not prepared to comment further. Dominion Textile president and chairman Thomas Bell was out of town and unavailable for comment. Dominion Textile last year made an unsuccesful 104-mln- U.S.-dlr bid for Avondale Mills and has maintained a 120-mln- U.S.-dlr line of credit to be used for an American acquisition. Dufour said the company has been negotiating with many U.S. textile companies but would not say whether Burlington Industries was one of them. Burlingtons stock rose sharply this morning on the report, which said Dominion Textile had joined with U.S. investor Asher Edelman to buy a stake in the company and to consider making a takeover offer. Dominion Textile, which reported operating profit of 11.1 mln Canadian dlrs last year on sales of 926.5 mln dlrs, has repeatedly said it will concentrate on expanding into the U.S. The company has said it plans to diversify into new product and market areas in addition to expanding its textile operations.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dominion_6.20	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Scottish_Textile_Workers'_Union	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dominion_Brewery	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Seth's_Dominion	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dominion_6.19	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dominion_Park	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Jharkhand_Silk_Textile_and_Handicraft_Development_Corporation	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Miss_Dominion_of_Canada	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Textiles_of_Mexico	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Red_Banner_Textile_Factory

Tokyo	320	325	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tokyo_Stock_Exchange	Exchanges and telecommunications authorities should abolish their restrictions on full and free dissemination of information to the investment and banking communities, Reuters Holdings Plc RTRS.L chairman Sir Christopher Hogg said. In the 1986 annual repoprt, he said lengthy negotiations had brought agreement with the Tokyo and London Stock Exchanges for fuller, but still not complete, access to market data through Reuter services. Many other markets maintain restrictions, he added. Hogg said members of some markets appear to believe that information restrictions protected their interests. In other cases, exchanges seem to be limiting the distribution of data in order to provide competitive advantage to their own commercial information businesses. He also noted that despite increasing liberalisation in the telecommunications field, some countries continue to protect their state monopolies at the expense of other economic sectors. Reuter dealing services remain excluded from such countries. As a result, banking communities serving entire economies are put at a competitive disadvantage, he added. Reuters increased its 1986 pre-tax profit by 39 pct from the previous year to 130.1 mln stg on a 43 pct rise in revenues to 620.9 mln stg. Earnings per ordinary share were up 47 pct to 19.4p.

Texacos stock rose 1/8 to 34-1/8. On Monday, the stock tumbled four points after the Supreme Court overturned a lower court decision that cut Texacos bond in the 10.3 billion dlr legal dispute with Pennzoil Co PZL to one billion dlrs. Yesterday, a Texas court granted a temporary injunction on the bond issue pending a hearing next week. The current litigation arose from Texacos buyout of Getty Oil Co in 1984. Pennzoil sued, arguing its earlier agreement to buy Getty was binding. Two Texas state courts upheld Pennzoils position. Randol, noting that the stock has suffered a great deal in the two years since the litigation was filed, said we recognize the legal problems but think investors have overdone it. He said the stock is selling at 48 pct of its asset value, and we think it represents a good value at this level.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/2000_Pennzoil_400	http://dbpedia.org/resource/1999_Pennzoil_400	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pennzoil	http://dbpedia.org/resource/2013_Shell-Pennzoil_Grand_Prix_of_Houston	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pennzoil_Place	http://dbpedia.org/resource/2001_Pennzoil_Freedom_400	http://dbpedia.org/resource/1997_Pennzoil_200

Dow	1748	1751	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dow_Chemical_Company	Cheap oil feedstocks, the weakened U.S. dollar and a plant utilization rate approaching 90 pct will propel the streamlined U.S. petrochemical industry to record profits this year, with growth expected through at least 1990, major company executives predicted. This bullish outlook for chemical manufacturing and an industrywide move to shed unrelated businesses has prompted GAF Corp (GAF), privately-held Cain Chemical Inc, and other firms to aggressively seek acquisitions of petrochemical plants. Oil companies such as Ashland Oil Inc (ASH), the Kentucky-based oil refiner and marketer, are also shopping for money-making petrochemical businesses to buy. I see us poised at the threshold of a golden period, said Paul Oreffice, chairman of giant Dow Chemical Co (DOW), adding, Theres no major plant capacity being added around the world now. The whole game is bringing out new products and improving the old ones. Analysts say the chemical industrys biggest customers, automobile manufacturers and home builders that use a lot of paints and plastics, are expected to buy quantities this year. U.S. petrochemical plants are currently operating at about 90 pct capacity, reflecting tighter supply that could hike product prices by 30 to 40 pct this year, said John Dosher, managing director of Pace Consultants Inc of Houston. Demand for some products such as styrene could push profit margins up by as much as 300 pct, he said. Oreffice, speaking at a meeting of chemical engineers in Houston, said Dow would easily top the 741 mln dlrs it earned last year and predicted it would have the best year in its history. In 1985, when oil prices were still above 25 dlrs a barrel and chemical exports were adversely affected by the strong U.S. dollar, Dow had profits of 58 mln dlrs. I believe the entire chemical industry is headed for a record year or close to it, Oreffice said. GAF chairman Samuel Heyman estimated that the U.S. chemical industry would report a 20 pct gain in profits during 1987. Last year, the domestic industry earned a total of 13 billion dlrs, a 54 pct leap from 1985. The turn in the fortunes of the once-sickly chemical industry has been brought about by a combination of luck and planning, said Paces John Dosher. Dosher said last years fall in oil prices made feedstocks dramatically cheaper and at the same time the American dollar was weakening against foreign currencies. That helped boost U.S. chemical exports. Also helping to bring supply and demand into balance has been the gradual market absorption of the extra chemical manufacturing capacity created by Middle Eastern oil producers in the early 1980s. Finally, virtually all major U.S. chemical manufacturers have embarked on an extensive corporate restructuring program to mothball inefficient plants, trim the payroll and eliminate unrelated businesses. The restructuring touched off a flurry of friendly and hostile takeover attempts. GAF, which made an unsuccessful attempt in 1985 to acquire Union Carbide Corp UK, recently offered three billion dlrs for Borg Warner Corp BOR, a Chicago manufacturer of plastics and chemicals. Another industry powerhouse, W.R. Grace (GRA) has divested its retailing, restaurant and fertilizer businesses to raise cash for chemical acquisitions. But some experts worry that the chemical industry may be headed for trouble if companies continue turning their back on the manufacturing of staple petrochemical commodities, such as ethylene, in favor of more profitable specialty chemicals that are custom-designed for a small group of buyers. Companies like DuPont (DD) and Monsanto Co MTC spent the past two or three years trying to get out of the commodity chemical business in reaction to how badly the market had deteriorated, Dosher said. But I think they will eventually kill the margins on the profitable chemicals in the niche market. Some top chemical executives share the concern. The challenge for our industry is to keep from getting carried away and repeating past mistakes, GAFs Heyman cautioned. The shift from commodity chemicals may be ill-advised. Specialty businesses do not stay special long. Houston-based Cain Chemical, created this month by the Sterling investment banking group, believes it can generate 700 mln dlrs in annual sales by bucking the industry trend. Chairman Gordon Cain, who previously led a leveraged buyout of Duponts Conoco Incs chemical business, has spent 1.1 billion dlrs since January to buy seven petrochemical plants along the Texas Gulf Coast. The plants produce only basic commodity petrochemicals that are the building blocks of specialty products.

Canada	824	830	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Canada	Britain intends to negotiate further agreements on international securities regulation to match those now in force with the U.S. And Japan, government sources said. The Department of Trade and Industry said earlier it had concluded a memorandum of understanding with Japans Finance Ministry to swap supervisory and investigatory information. The agreement covers stocks, shares and government bonds, but not commodity futures, whose regulation in Japan does not come under the Finance Ministry. It therefore does not cover some transactions on the London International Financial Futures Exchange and the London commodities and metal exchanges. The DTI said it hoped to seek further understandings with other countries which met in the U.K. Last December. The meeting involved delegates from the U.K., Switzerland, the U.S., Canada, Australia, Hong Kong, Japan, France, West Germany and Holland. Government sources said the deal with Japan completes arrangements linking Tokyo, the U.S. And London. A U.K. Agreement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) was signed last September. Todays agreement will deal with requests for information on a case by case basis, U.K. Government sources said. It is not legally binding and comes into force immediately.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/ISNA_Canada	http://dbpedia.org/resource/5th_Parliament_of_Upper_Canada	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Nuclear_industry_in_Canada	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tobacco_Act_(Canada)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/2002_Air_Canada_Cup	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Amazon.com_Inc_v_Canada_(Commissioner_of_Patents)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Chinavision_Canada	http://dbpedia.org/resource/International_Education_association_of_western_canada	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Nouvelle_Alliance_Québec-Canada	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mount_Columbia_(Canada)

Houston	1487	1494	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Houston	Cheap oil feedstocks, the weakened U.S. dollar and a plant utilization rate approaching 90 pct will propel the streamlined U.S. petrochemical industry to record profits this year, with growth expected through at least 1990, major company executives predicted. This bullish outlook for chemical manufacturing and an industrywide move to shed unrelated businesses has prompted GAF Corp (GAF), privately-held Cain Chemical Inc, and other firms to aggressively seek acquisitions of petrochemical plants. Oil companies such as Ashland Oil Inc (ASH), the Kentucky-based oil refiner and marketer, are also shopping for money-making petrochemical businesses to buy. I see us poised at the threshold of a golden period, said Paul Oreffice, chairman of giant Dow Chemical Co (DOW), adding, Theres no major plant capacity being added around the world now. The whole game is bringing out new products and improving the old ones. Analysts say the chemical industrys biggest customers, automobile manufacturers and home builders that use a lot of paints and plastics, are expected to buy quantities this year. U.S. petrochemical plants are currently operating at about 90 pct capacity, reflecting tighter supply that could hike product prices by 30 to 40 pct this year, said John Dosher, managing director of Pace Consultants Inc of Houston. Demand for some products such as styrene could push profit margins up by as much as 300 pct, he said. Oreffice, speaking at a meeting of chemical engineers in Houston, said Dow would easily top the 741 mln dlrs it earned last year and predicted it would have the best year in its history. In 1985, when oil prices were still above 25 dlrs a barrel and chemical exports were adversely affected by the strong U.S. dollar, Dow had profits of 58 mln dlrs. I believe the entire chemical industry is headed for a record year or close to it, Oreffice said. GAF chairman Samuel Heyman estimated that the U.S. chemical industry would report a 20 pct gain in profits during 1987. Last year, the domestic industry earned a total of 13 billion dlrs, a 54 pct leap from 1985. The turn in the fortunes of the once-sickly chemical industry has been brought about by a combination of luck and planning, said Paces John Dosher. Dosher said last years fall in oil prices made feedstocks dramatically cheaper and at the same time the American dollar was weakening against foreign currencies. That helped boost U.S. chemical exports. Also helping to bring supply and demand into balance has been the gradual market absorption of the extra chemical manufacturing capacity created by Middle Eastern oil producers in the early 1980s. Finally, virtually all major U.S. chemical manufacturers have embarked on an extensive corporate restructuring program to mothball inefficient plants, trim the payroll and eliminate unrelated businesses. The restructuring touched off a flurry of friendly and hostile takeover attempts. GAF, which made an unsuccessful attempt in 1985 to acquire Union Carbide Corp UK, recently offered three billion dlrs for Borg Warner Corp BOR, a Chicago manufacturer of plastics and chemicals. Another industry powerhouse, W.R. Grace (GRA) has divested its retailing, restaurant and fertilizer businesses to raise cash for chemical acquisitions. But some experts worry that the chemical industry may be headed for trouble if companies continue turning their back on the manufacturing of staple petrochemical commodities, such as ethylene, in favor of more profitable specialty chemicals that are custom-designed for a small group of buyers. Companies like DuPont (DD) and Monsanto Co MTC spent the past two or three years trying to get out of the commodity chemical business in reaction to how badly the market had deteriorated, Dosher said. But I think they will eventually kill the margins on the profitable chemicals in the niche market. Some top chemical executives share the concern. The challenge for our industry is to keep from getting carried away and repeating past mistakes, GAFs Heyman cautioned. The shift from commodity chemicals may be ill-advised. Specialty businesses do not stay special long. Houston-based Cain Chemical, created this month by the Sterling investment banking group, believes it can generate 700 mln dlrs in annual sales by bucking the industry trend. Chairman Gordon Cain, who previously led a leveraged buyout of Duponts Conoco Incs chemical business, has spent 1.1 billion dlrs since January to buy seven petrochemical plants along the Texas Gulf Coast. The plants produce only basic commodity petrochemicals that are the building blocks of specialty products. This kind of commodity chemical business will never be a glamorous, high-margin business, Cain said, adding that demand is expected to grow by about three pct annually. Garo Armen, an analyst with Dean Witter Reynolds, said chemical makers have also benefitted by increasing demand for plastics as prices become more competitive with aluminum, wood and steel products. Armen estimated the upturn in the chemical business could last as long as four or five years, provided the U.S. economy continues its modest rate of growth.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pleasantville,_Houston	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Houston_Academy	http://dbpedia.org/resource/2015–16_Houston_Cougars_women's_basketball_team	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Union_Station_(Houston)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/2003–04_Houston_Rockets_season	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Lakes_of_Parkway,_Houston	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Houston_Astros_award_winners_and_league_leaders	http://dbpedia.org/resource/James_Houston_(judge)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/West_End_Park_(Houston)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/James_Houston_Spence
VW	1022	1024	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Volkswagen_Group	Volkswagen AG VOWG.F, VW, is due to make a formal announcement about its 1986 dividend tomorrow after saying the 1985 level of 10 marks per ordinary share would be held, despite massive losses because of a suspected foreign currency fraud. A spokesman said VWs supervisory board will meet tomorrow to discuss the payout. A statement will be made afterwards. VW has also said disclosed profits for 1986 will reach their 1985 level, despite provisions of a possible 480 mln marks linked to the currency affair. The figure is virtually the same as the 477 mln mark 1985 parent company net profit. When VW first confirmed the currency scandal on March 10 it said the management board would propose an unchanged 10-mark dividend to the supervisory board. A dividend of 11 marks would be proposed for the companys new preference shares. Share analysts said they saw supervisory board approval of the management board proposal as virtually a formality. Anything else would be more than a surprise, one said. Company sources said VW would have to dig into reserves to maintain the disclosed profit. Parent company reserves stood at around three billion marks at end-1985.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/VW_Hydri	http://dbpedia.org/resource/VW_Herald	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cal-Style_VW	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Better_Half_VW	http://dbpedia.org/resource/VW_276_Schlepperfahrzeug	http://dbpedia.org/resource/VW_Cephei	http://dbpedia.org/resource/VW_Electronics_Research_Laboratory

Brazil	1258	1264	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Brazil	Major cocoa exporters are likely to limit sales in the weeks ahead in an effort to boost world prices, sources close to a meeting of the Cocoa Producers Alliance (CPA) said. The sources said the depressed world market had been one of the main topics discussed in a closed door meeting of the 11-member CPA which began on Monday. They said producers agreed that cutting sales would aid the buffer stock manager of a new international cocoa pact in his effort to support prices. Major cocoa producing and consuming nations agreed operation rules for the buffer stock at a meeting in London last month and the stock manager is expected to enter the market soon. Prices, under the weight of three successive cocoa surpluses, recently fell to the level at which the manager has to buy cocoa under stock rules. The buffer stock aims to keep prices within a pre-set range by buying when prices fall and selling when they rise. The worlds cocoa price at present is just not interesting, commented one delegate representing a major CPA producer. Another source said that with much of the 1986/87 (October-September) world cocoa crop sold, limiting sales in the near term concerns essentially next years harvest. The sources noted, however, that the cocoa industry in Brazil, the worlds number two producer, is in private hands. This means limiting sales is more difficult than in major West African producers, where sales are made or authorized by commodity marketing boards. The CPA includes the worlds top three producers, Ivory Coast, Brazil and Ghana, and accounts for 80 pct of all output. The meeting here is due to end tomorrow evening.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Health_in_Brazil	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Avianca_Brazil_destinations	http://dbpedia.org/resource/List_of_wars_involving_Brazil	http://dbpedia.org/resource/1922_in_Brazil	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Brazil_International	http://dbpedia.org/resource/List_of_capitals_of_subdivisions_of_Brazil	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Brazil_at_the_2007_UCI_Road_World_Championships	http://dbpedia.org/resource/President_of_the_Federal_Senate_(Brazil)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Superior_Court_of_Justice_(Brazil)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/United_States_Army_Medical_Research_Unit-Brazil
Noranda	617	624	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Noranda_(mining_company)	Quebec mines minister Raymond Savoie said the province is prepared to offer money to help re-open (Noranda Inc))'s Murdochville, Quebec copper mine, shut down by fire last week, but said he could not give a specific figure until damage estimates have been completed. Federal member of parliament for the region,  Charles-Eugene Marin, said last week the federal government is also prepared to provide financial help to restart operations as soon as possible. Noranda has estimated damage from the fire at about 10 mln dlrs and a company spokesman said it should have a more specific estimate by the end of the month. Noranda said it had hoped to have an estimate sooner, but has found that it will take longer than expected to gain access to the burned-out area. Noranda said the mine was not insured.  said the mine was not insured.

Japan	1851	1856	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Japan	Senior Japanese officials tomorrow open talks with American trade negotiators in a last-ditch effort to avert new high U.S. tariffs to be imposed on a wide variety of Japanese electronic exports. Makoto Kuroda, vice minister of Japans Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI), is to hold two days of meetings with the Deputy U.S. Trade Representative, Michael Smith, and the Under Secretary of Commerce, Bruce Smart. The new tariffs, to go into effect on April 17, are in retaliation for Japans failure to adhere to an agreement to end dumping semiconductors in world markets at below cost and to open its home market to U.S. semiconductor shipments. They are to be imposed on goods which use semiconductors, including television and audio equipment and computers. Both U.S. and Japanese officials have said there was little likelihood the talks would do anything to avert the 100 pct duties on 300 mln dlrs worth of Japanese shipments. President Reagan announced the planned tariffs on March 27 after he said that close monitoring of the July 1986 U.S.-Japanese semiconductor pact convinced U.S. officials that Japan was not honoring the agreement. In making the annoucement, Reagan said I am committed to the full enforcement of our trade agreements designed to provide American industry with free and fair trade. Trade analysts said his move was aimed as much at Japans semiconductor trade practices, which are said to have injured the U.S. semiconductor industry, as Congress, which has complained about presidential timidity on trade issues. Congressional Democrats have pledged to enact aggressive trade laws to counter what they contend has been Reagans inaction to redress the growing U.S. trade deficit, which last year reached 169.8 billion dlrs. About one-third of the deficit was with Japan. Reagan said there were recent signs Japan was beginning to adhere to the pact and that was why he was not terminating it. Kuroda said on leaving Tokyo today he had no new proposals but did have an explanation of the semiconductor situation. He told the daily newspaper Ashai Shimbun that Reagans decision was based on inaccurate data and an exaggerated sense of MITIs power to control Japanese traders. The United States has excessive expectations., he said. To stabilize supply-demand relations which have been disrupted by excess inventories since 1985 will take some time. He also said that U.S. firms had not been aggressive enough in trying to sell in the Japanese market.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Democratic_Party_(Japan)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Japan_Aviation_High_School	http://dbpedia.org/resource/List_of_Koreans_in_Japan	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Japan_Turbine_Technologies	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Japan_National_Route_337	http://dbpedia.org/resource/International_rankings_of_Japan	http://dbpedia.org/resource/National_Institute_for_Basic_Biology,_Japan	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Japan_National_Route_376	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Japan_National_Route_226	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Japan_National_Route_391

Southern Co	193	204	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Southern_Company	An audit submitted to the Georgia Public Service Commission claims that between 944 mln dlrs and 1.8 billion dlrs of the costs of the Plant Vogtle nuclear power station should be disallowed, a Southern Co spokeswoman said. Southerns Georgia Power Co subsidiary has a 45.7 pct interest in the plant and estimated earlier this year it would cost a total of 8.87 billion dlrs. Last year, the plants owners pledged to Georgia regulators they would limit the cost passed on to rate payers to 8.4 billion dlrs. The Southern spokeswoman said the company feels the report by OBrien-Kreitzberg is flawed and biased. She said the report was released yesterday by the state attorney general. Responding to the report today, Georgia Power Chairman Robert W. Scherer told a news conference the conclusions drawn by the firm are not only wrong -- they also reflect the same bias against nuclear power that these auditors have demonstrated in similar cases accross the country. Saying he was not suggesting Georgia power was without fault, Scherer said the audit identified several things I wish we had done differently. Scherer pointed out a report OBrien-Kreitzberg submitted to Georgia regulators in March 1986 projected Georgia Power would not finish Plant Vogtle unit one before the end of 1987. Noting unit one is finished, and we expect it to be in commercial operationg by June, he said the firms latest report ignored the earlier projection, gave the utility no credit for the completion and actually penalized us by suggesting that costs to maintain t he schedule be disallowed. Scherer said the latest audit alleges Georgia Power could have saved 95 mln dlrs if it had stopped using four shifts, seven days a week to speed construction three years sooner.

Supreme Court	350	363	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States	First Boston Corp analyst William Randol recommended the purchase of Texaco Inc today, saying the discount that investors have made in the share price to reflect the ongoing litigation with Pennzoil has been overdone relative to how we expect the case to conclude. Texacos stock rose 1/8 to 34-1/8. On Monday, the stock tumbled four points after the Supreme Court overturned a lower court decision that cut Texacos bond in the 10.3 billion dlr legal dispute with Pennzoil Co PZL to one billion dlrs. Yesterday, a Texas court granted a temporary injunction on the bond issue pending a hearing next week. The current litigation arose from Texacos buyout of Getty Oil Co in 1984. Pennzoil sued, arguing its earlier agreement to buy Getty was binding. Two Texas state courts upheld Pennzoils position. Randol, noting that the stock has suffered a great deal in the two years since the litigation was filed, said we recognize the legal problems but think investors have overdone it. He said the stock is selling at 48 pct of its asset value, and we think it represents a good value at this level.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/1995_U.S._Men's_Clay_Court_Championships_–_Singles	http://dbpedia.org/resource/1991_U.S._Men's_Clay_Court_Championships_–_Doubles	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Supreme_Sultan	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Supreme_Team_(band)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Nedenes_District_Court	http://dbpedia.org/resource/List_of_Purveyors_to_the_Court_of_Denmark	http://dbpedia.org/resource/List_of_United_States_Supreme_Court_cases,_volume_248	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Queen_Elizabeth_II_Courts_of_Law,_Brisbane	http://dbpedia.org/resource/List_of_United_States_Supreme_Court_cases,_volume_534	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Snaresbrook_Crown_Court
Georgia	1166	1173	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Georgia_Power	An audit submitted to the Georgia Public Service Commission claims that between 944 mln dlrs and 1.8 billion dlrs of the costs of the Plant Vogtle nuclear power station should be disallowed, a Southern Co spokeswoman said. Southerns Georgia Power Co subsidiary has a 45.7 pct interest in the plant and estimated earlier this year it would cost a total of 8.87 billion dlrs. Last year, the plants owners pledged to Georgia regulators they would limit the cost passed on to rate payers to 8.4 billion dlrs. The Southern spokeswoman said the company feels the report by OBrien-Kreitzberg is flawed and biased. She said the report was released yesterday by the state attorney general. Responding to the report today, Georgia Power Chairman Robert W. Scherer told a news conference the conclusions drawn by the firm are not only wrong -- they also reflect the same bias against nuclear power that these auditors have demonstrated in similar cases accross the country. Saying he was not suggesting Georgia power was without fault, Scherer said the audit identified several things I wish we had done differently. Scherer pointed out a report OBrien-Kreitzberg submitted to Georgia regulators in March 1986 projected Georgia Power would not finish Plant Vogtle unit one before the end of 1987. Noting unit one is finished, and we expect it to be in commercial operationg by June, he said the firms latest report ignored the earlier projection, gave the utility no credit for the completion and actually penalized us by suggesting that costs to maintain t he schedule be disallowed. Scherer said the latest audit alleges Georgia Power could have saved 95 mln dlrs if it had stopped using four shifts, seven days a week to speed construction three years sooner. He said this would have delayed completion of the plant for another year and it would have cost several hunderd million dlrs more. Noting the audit said costs were increased 600 mln dlrs by schedule delays totaling 20.5 months, he said First, we have the best concrete placement record in the industry, Second new government regulations after the Three Mile Island incident significantly increased construction time.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/List_of_mayors_of_Peachtree_City,_Georgia	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Reindeer_in_South_Georgia	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Georgia_on_My_Mind_(novelette)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/1971_Georgia_500	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Columbia_County_Courthouse_(Georgia)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/2000_Georgia_Bulldogs_football_team	http://dbpedia.org/resource/North_Columbus,_Georgia	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Economy_of_Georgia_(country)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Georgia_Bulldogs_basketball	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Georgia_State_Route_171
Garo Armen	4792	4802	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Garo_H._Armen	Cheap oil feedstocks, the weakened U.S. dollar and a plant utilization rate approaching 90 pct will propel the streamlined U.S. petrochemical industry to record profits this year, with growth expected through at least 1990, major company executives predicted. This bullish outlook for chemical manufacturing and an industrywide move to shed unrelated businesses has prompted GAF Corp (GAF), privately-held Cain Chemical Inc, and other firms to aggressively seek acquisitions of petrochemical plants. Oil companies such as Ashland Oil Inc (ASH), the Kentucky-based oil refiner and marketer, are also shopping for money-making petrochemical businesses to buy. I see us poised at the threshold of a golden period, said Paul Oreffice, chairman of giant Dow Chemical Co (DOW), adding, Theres no major plant capacity being added around the world now. The whole game is bringing out new products and improving the old ones. Analysts say the chemical industrys biggest customers, automobile manufacturers and home builders that use a lot of paints and plastics, are expected to buy quantities this year. U.S. petrochemical plants are currently operating at about 90 pct capacity, reflecting tighter supply that could hike product prices by 30 to 40 pct this year, said John Dosher, managing director of Pace Consultants Inc of Houston. Demand for some products such as styrene could push profit margins up by as much as 300 pct, he said. Oreffice, speaking at a meeting of chemical engineers in Houston, said Dow would easily top the 741 mln dlrs it earned last year and predicted it would have the best year in its history. In 1985, when oil prices were still above 25 dlrs a barrel and chemical exports were adversely affected by the strong U.S. dollar, Dow had profits of 58 mln dlrs. I believe the entire chemical industry is headed for a record year or close to it, Oreffice said. GAF chairman Samuel Heyman estimated that the U.S. chemical industry would report a 20 pct gain in profits during 1987. Last year, the domestic industry earned a total of 13 billion dlrs, a 54 pct leap from 1985. The turn in the fortunes of the once-sickly chemical industry has been brought about by a combination of luck and planning, said Paces John Dosher. Dosher said last years fall in oil prices made feedstocks dramatically cheaper and at the same time the American dollar was weakening against foreign currencies. That helped boost U.S. chemical exports. Also helping to bring supply and demand into balance has been the gradual market absorption of the extra chemical manufacturing capacity created by Middle Eastern oil producers in the early 1980s. Finally, virtually all major U.S. chemical manufacturers have embarked on an extensive corporate restructuring program to mothball inefficient plants, trim the payroll and eliminate unrelated businesses. The restructuring touched off a flurry of friendly and hostile takeover attempts. GAF, which made an unsuccessful attempt in 1985 to acquire Union Carbide Corp UK, recently offered three billion dlrs for Borg Warner Corp BOR, a Chicago manufacturer of plastics and chemicals. Another industry powerhouse, W.R. Grace (GRA) has divested its retailing, restaurant and fertilizer businesses to raise cash for chemical acquisitions. But some experts worry that the chemical industry may be headed for trouble if companies continue turning their back on the manufacturing of staple petrochemical commodities, such as ethylene, in favor of more profitable specialty chemicals that are custom-designed for a small group of buyers. Companies like DuPont (DD) and Monsanto Co MTC spent the past two or three years trying to get out of the commodity chemical business in reaction to how badly the market had deteriorated, Dosher said. But I think they will eventually kill the margins on the profitable chemicals in the niche market. Some top chemical executives share the concern. The challenge for our industry is to keep from getting carried away and repeating past mistakes, GAFs Heyman cautioned. The shift from commodity chemicals may be ill-advised. Specialty businesses do not stay special long. Houston-based Cain Chemical, created this month by the Sterling investment banking group, believes it can generate 700 mln dlrs in annual sales by bucking the industry trend. Chairman Gordon Cain, who previously led a leveraged buyout of Duponts Conoco Incs chemical business, has spent 1.1 billion dlrs since January to buy seven petrochemical plants along the Texas Gulf Coast. The plants produce only basic commodity petrochemicals that are the building blocks of specialty products. This kind of commodity chemical business will never be a glamorous, high-margin business, Cain said, adding that demand is expected to grow by about three pct annually. Garo Armen, an analyst with Dean Witter Reynolds, said chemical makers have also benefitted by increasing demand for plastics as prices become more competitive with aluminum, wood and steel products. Armen estimated the upturn in the chemical business could last as long as four or five years, provided the U.S. economy continues its modest rate of growth.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Garo_Kahkejian	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Armen_Mazmanyan	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Armen_Agop	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Armen_Garo	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Armen_Movsisyan	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Armen_Tigranyan	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Garo_language	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Armen_Stepanyan	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Garo_Special:_Byakuya_no_Maju	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Armen_Ghazaryan

John Shad	35	44	http://dbpedia.org/resource/John_S.R._Shad	Securities and Exchange Commission John Shad said he wanted Congress to write a better definition of insider trading but thought action should wait until the Supreme Court ruled on an insider trading case. Id like the benefit of the Winans decision before deciding on a definition, Shad told a Senate Appropriations subcommittee hearing. Shad was refering to the appeal by former Wall Street Journal reporter R. Foster Winans of his conviction on insider trading charges for telling a friend in advance what stocks he was going to write about in his column. The stocks usually went up or down in price depending on Winans recommendation. He said insider trading accounted for only 11 percent of the SECs enforcement activities last year despite the publicity given to recent major cases. Insider trading makes up only a tiny fraction of one pct of the 50 billion dlrs of daily securities trading, Shad said. Shad asked for a budget increase so the SEC could enlarge its enforcement staff by 20 this year and 73 next year to deal with all types of securities fraud. Shad said he hoped to start his new duties as U.S. Ambassador to the Netherlands by June. He said he did not know when his successor would be named by President Reagan.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sean_John_McCann	http://dbpedia.org/resource/John_W._Fuller	http://dbpedia.org/resource/John_Rocque	http://dbpedia.org/resource/John_Lisle_Hall_McFarlane	http://dbpedia.org/resource/John_McConnell_(footballer)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sir_John_Appleby	http://dbpedia.org/resource/John_Schneller	http://dbpedia.org/resource/John_II_of_Luxembourg,_Count_of_Ligny	http://dbpedia.org/resource/John_Gazzola	http://dbpedia.org/resource/John_Sadri
Japan	1123	1128	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Japan	Senior Japanese officials tomorrow open talks with American trade negotiators in a last-ditch effort to avert new high U.S. tariffs to be imposed on a wide variety of Japanese electronic exports. Makoto Kuroda, vice minister of Japans Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI), is to hold two days of meetings with the Deputy U.S. Trade Representative, Michael Smith, and the Under Secretary of Commerce, Bruce Smart. The new tariffs, to go into effect on April 17, are in retaliation for Japans failure to adhere to an agreement to end dumping semiconductors in world markets at below cost and to open its home market to U.S. semiconductor shipments. They are to be imposed on goods which use semiconductors, including television and audio equipment and computers. Both U.S. and Japanese officials have said there was little likelihood the talks would do anything to avert the 100 pct duties on 300 mln dlrs worth of Japanese shipments. President Reagan announced the planned tariffs on March 27 after he said that close monitoring of the July 1986 U.S.-Japanese semiconductor pact convinced U.S. officials that Japan was not honoring the agreement. In making the annoucement, Reagan said I am committed to the full enforcement of our trade agreements designed to provide American industry with free and fair trade. Trade analysts said his move was aimed as much at Japans semiconductor trade practices, which are said to have injured the U.S. semiconductor industry, as Congress, which has complained about presidential timidity on trade issues. Congressional Democrats have pledged to enact aggressive trade laws to counter what they contend has been Reagans inaction to redress the growing U.S. trade deficit, which last year reached 169.8 billion dlrs. About one-third of the deficit was with Japan. Reagan said there were recent signs Japan was beginning to adhere to the pact and that was why he was not terminating it. Kuroda said on leaving Tokyo today he had no new proposals but did have an explanation of the semiconductor situation. He told the daily newspaper Ashai Shimbun that Reagans decision was based on inaccurate data and an exaggerated sense of MITIs power to control Japanese traders. The United States has excessive expectations., he said. To stabilize supply-demand relations which have been disrupted by excess inventories since 1985 will take some time. He also said that U.S. firms had not been aggressive enough in trying to sell in the Japanese market.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/2008_MTV_Video_Music_Awards_Japan	http://dbpedia.org/resource/List_of_Places_of_Scenic_Beauty_of_Japan_(Saga)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/2006_AIG_Japan_Open_Tennis_Championships_–_Men's_Singles	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Japan_National_Route_208	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ministry_of_Posts_and_Telecommunications_(Japan)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/List_of_Cultural_Properties_of_Japan_-_paintings_(Tokushima)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Japan_National_Route_227	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Philosophical_Association_of_Japan	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Japan_national_football_team_results_(2010–19)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/2015_Shimadzu_All_Japan_Indoor_Tennis_Championships_–_Singles

Santa Fe	2281	2289	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Santa_Fe_Province	Argentine grain producers adjusted their yield estimates for the 1986/87 coarse grain crop downward in the week to yesterday after the heavy rains at the end of March and beginning of April, trade sources said. They said sunflower, maize and sorghum production estimates had been reduced despite some later warm, dry weather, which has allowed a return to harvesting in some areas. However, as showers fell intermittently after last weekend, producers feared another spell of prolonged and intense rain could cause more damage to crops already badly hit this season. Rains in the middle of last week reached an average of 27 millimetres in parts of Buenos Aires province, 83 mm in Cordoba, 41 in Santa Fe, 50 in Entre Rios and Misiones, 95 in Corrientes, eight in Chaco and 35 in Formosa. There was no rainfall in the same period in La Pampa. Producers feared continued damp conditions could produce rotting and lead to still lower yield estimates for all the crops, including soybean. However, as the lands began drying later in the week harvesting advanced considerably, reaching between 36 and 40 pct of the area sown in the case of sunflower. Deterioration of the sunflower crop evident in harvested material in Cordoba, La Pampa and Buenos Aires forced yield estimates per hectare to be adjusted down again. The seasons sunflowerseed production is now forecast at 2.1 mln to 2.3 mln tonnes, against 2.2 mln to 2.4 mln forecast last week and down 43.9 to 48.8 pct on the 1985/86 record of 4.1 mln. Area sown to sunflowers was two to 2.2 mln hectares, 29.9 to 36.3 pct below the record 3.14 mln hectares last season. Maize harvesting has also reached 36 to 40 pct of the area sown. It is near completion in Cordoba and Santa Fe and will begin in La Pampa and southern Buenos Aires later in April. Production estimates for maize were down from last week at 9.5 mln to 9.8 mln tonnes, against 9.6 mln to 9.9 mln estimated previously. This is 22.2 to 23.4 pct below the 12.4 mln to 12.6 mln tonnes estimated by private sources for the 1985/86 crop and 21.9 to 25.8 pct down on the official figure of 12.8 mln tonnes. Maize was sown on 3.58 mln to 3.78 mln hectares, two to seven pct down on last seasons 3.85 mln. Sorghum was harvested on 23 to 25 pct of the area sown in Cordoba, Santa Fe and Chaco. Harvest will start in La Pampa and Buenos Aires in mid-April. The total area sown was 1.23 mln to 1.30 mln hectares, 10.3 to 15.2 pct down on the 1.45 mln sown last season. The new forecast for the sorghum crop is 2.9 mln to 3.2 mln tonnes compared with three mln to 3.3 mln forecast last week, and is 23.8 to 29.3 pct down on last seasons 4.1 mln to 4.2 mln tonne crop. The soybean crop for this season was not adjusted, remaining at a record 7.5 mln to 7.7 mln tonnes, up 4.2 to 5.5 pct on the 7.2 mln to 7.3 mln estimated by private sources for 1985/86 and 5.6 to 8.5 pct higher than the official figure of 7.1 mln. The area sown to soybeans this season was a record 3.7 mln to 3.8 mln hectares, 10.8 to 13.8 pct up on the record 3.34 mln sown in 1985/86. The soybean crop is showing excessive moisture in some areas and producers fear they may discover more damage. Some experimental harvesting was carried out in Santa Fe on areas making up only about one pct of the total crop but details on this were not available. Preparation of the fields for the 1987/88 wheat crop, which will be sown between May and August or September, has so far not been as intense as in previous years.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Basílica_Catedral_Metropolitana_Santa_María_de_la_Encarnación	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Valley_Christian_Academy_(Santa_Maria,_California)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Santa_Cecilia	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Santa_Bárbara_(Ponta_Delgada)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Roman_Catholic_Archdiocese_of_Santa_Maria	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Santa_and_Pete	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Santa_Fe_impact_structure	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Rancho_Santa_Rita	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Santa_Fe_5	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Rancho_Santa_Rosa_(Moreno)

U.S	818	821	http://dbpedia.org/resource/United_States	Britain intends to negotiate further agreements on international securities regulation to match those now in force with the U.S. And Japan, government sources said. The Department of Trade and Industry said earlier it had concluded a memorandum of understanding with Japans Finance Ministry to swap supervisory and investigatory information. The agreement covers stocks, shares and government bonds, but not commodity futures, whose regulation in Japan does not come under the Finance Ministry. It therefore does not cover some transactions on the London International Financial Futures Exchange and the London commodities and metal exchanges. The DTI said it hoped to seek further understandings with other countries which met in the U.K. Last December. The meeting involved delegates from the U.K., Switzerland, the U.S., Canada, Australia, Hong Kong, Japan, France, West Germany and Holland. Government sources said the deal with Japan completes arrangements linking Tokyo, the U.S. And London. A U.K. Agreement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) was signed last September. Todays agreement will deal with requests for information on a case by case basis, U.K. Government sources said.

This bullish outlook for chemical manufacturing and an industrywide move to shed unrelated businesses has prompted GAF Corp (GAF), privately-held Cain Chemical Inc, and other firms to aggressively seek acquisitions of petrochemical plants. Oil companies such as Ashland Oil Inc (ASH), the Kentucky-based oil refiner and marketer, are also shopping for money-making petrochemical businesses to buy. I see us poised at the threshold of a golden period, said Paul Oreffice, chairman of giant Dow Chemical Co (DOW), adding, Theres no major plant capacity being added around the world now. The whole game is bringing out new products and improving the old ones. Analysts say the chemical industrys biggest customers, automobile manufacturers and home builders that use a lot of paints and plastics, are expected to buy quantities this year. U.S. petrochemical plants are currently operating at about 90 pct capacity, reflecting tighter supply that could hike product prices by 30 to 40 pct this year, said John Dosher, managing director of Pace Consultants Inc of Houston. Demand for some products such as styrene could push profit margins up by as much as 300 pct, he said. Oreffice, speaking at a meeting of chemical engineers in Houston, said Dow would easily top the 741 mln dlrs it earned last year and predicted it would have the best year in its history. In 1985, when oil prices were still above 25 dlrs a barrel and chemical exports were adversely affected by the strong U.S. dollar, Dow had profits of 58 mln dlrs. I believe the entire chemical industry is headed for a record year or close to it, Oreffice said. GAF chairman Samuel Heyman estimated that the U.S. chemical industry would report a 20 pct gain in profits during 1987. Last year, the domestic industry earned a total of 13 billion dlrs, a 54 pct leap from 1985. The turn in the fortunes of the once-sickly chemical industry has been brought about by a combination of luck and planning, said Paces John Dosher. Dosher said last years fall in oil prices made feedstocks dramatically cheaper and at the same time the American dollar was weakening against foreign currencies. That helped boost U.S. chemical exports. Also helping to bring supply and demand into balance has been the gradual market absorption of the extra chemical manufacturing capacity created by Middle Eastern oil producers in the early 1980s. Finally, virtually all major U.S. chemical manufacturers have embarked on an extensive corporate restructuring program to mothball inefficient plants, trim the payroll and eliminate unrelated businesses. The restructuring touched off a flurry of friendly and hostile takeover attempts. GAF, which made an unsuccessful attempt in 1985 to acquire Union Carbide Corp UK, recently offered three billion dlrs for Borg Warner Corp BOR, a Chicago manufacturer of plastics and chemicals. Another industry powerhouse, W.R. Grace (GRA) has divested its retailing, restaurant and fertilizer businesses to raise cash for chemical acquisitions. But some experts worry that the chemical industry may be headed for trouble if companies continue turning their back on the manufacturing of staple petrochemical commodities, such as ethylene, in favor of more profitable specialty chemicals that are custom-designed for a small group of buyers. Companies like DuPont (DD) and Monsanto Co MTC spent the past two or three years trying to get out of the commodity chemical business in reaction to how badly the market had deteriorated, Dosher said. But I think they will eventually kill the margins on the profitable chemicals in the niche market. Some top chemical executives share the concern. The challenge for our industry is to keep from getting carried away and repeating past mistakes, GAFs Heyman cautioned. The shift from commodity chemicals may be ill-advised. Specialty businesses do not stay special long. Houston-based Cain Chemical, created this month by the Sterling investment banking group, believes it can generate 700 mln dlrs in annual sales by bucking the industry trend. Chairman Gordon Cain, who previously led a leveraged buyout of Duponts Conoco Incs chemical business, has spent 1.1 billion dlrs since January to buy seven petrochemical plants along the Texas Gulf Coast. The plants produce only basic commodity petrochemicals that are the building blocks of specialty products. This kind of commodity chemical business will never be a glamorous, high-margin business, Cain said, adding that demand is expected to grow by about three pct annually. Garo Armen, an analyst with Dean Witter Reynolds, said chemical makers have also benefitted by increasing demand for plastics as prices become more competitive with aluminum, wood and steel products. Armen estimated the upturn in the chemical business could last as long as four or five years, provided the U.S. economy continues its modest rate of growth.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Al_Bunayyat_ash_Shamaliyah	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bethlehem,_Mountain_Ash	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ash_Avildsen	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ash_&_Bloom	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Man_of_Ashes	http://dbpedia.org/resource/%60Urjan_ash_Sharqiyah	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Emerald_ash_borer	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ash-Shifa	http://dbpedia.org/resource/RAF_Ash	http://dbpedia.org/resource/1962–63_Ashes_series
Onno Ruding	496	507	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Onno_Ruding	Dutch state-owned chemical firm NV DSM (DSMN.AS), the former Dutch state mines, which today reported a 2.5 pct increase in 1986 net profit to 412 mln guilders, said it was poised to be privatised, possibly next year. DSM chairman Hans van Liemt told journalists We have done our homework. Were ready. It is up to the state now. He said a public sale of 30 pct of DSMs assets in 1988 was not unlikely, but the timing of the sell-off was entirely in the hands of Parliament. Dutch Finance Minister Onno Ruding is known to be a proponent of privatisation, and the centre-right government coalition mentioned plans to privatise DSM in its policy declaration last autumn. Van Liemt would not speculate on a possible market price, but said his company had raised its total 1986 dividend to 98 mln guilders, almost 25 pct of 1986 net profit. We ought to be able to match our German competitors on price earnings ratio, although the Amsterdam bourse generally has a lower ratio than the worlds major exchanges,  he said. The average Dutch price/earnings ratio is 10.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Onno_Jacobs	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Rogers_Ruding	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Onno_van_de_Stolpe	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Onno_Tunç	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Onno_Hoes	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Onno_J._Boxma	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Onno_Shomoy	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Onno_Boelee	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Onno_Klopp

Calif	381	386	http://dbpedia.org/resource/California	Promising new findings in the use of a controversial experimental drug called Interleukin-2 as a cure for cancer will be published in the April 9 issue of the prestigious New England Journal of Medicine, according to a Wall Street analyst who has obtained an advance copy of the magazine. Among interleukins principal U. S. makers are Cetus Corp CTUS, headquartered in Emeryville, Calif., and Immunex Corp IMNX, based in Seattle, Wash. The journal, to be released late today, contains two articles reporting high remission rates several cancer types. The journal also contains a signed editorial concluding that the new results mark a significant milestone in the search for a successful immunotherapy for cancer. Interleukin-2, also known as IL-2, is a substance naturally produced by living cells in the laboratory. The drug is controversial because it was widely praised as a promising cancer treatment in early reports on its effectiveness in late 1985, only to come under criticism a year later for its failure to live up to its promise and due to its ravaging side effects. One of the new studies, conducted by Dr. William West of Biotherapeutics Inc of Franklin, Tenn., is particularly significant because it found far fewer harsh side effects after it changed the way in which the drug is administered. In that study, researchers administered IL-2 to 48 cancer patients and found a 50-pct remission rate for kidney cancers and a 50 pct remission rate for melanoma, a type of skin cancer, according to Prudential-Bache Securities Stuart Weisbrod, who obtained the advance copy of the magazine. For rectal and colon cancer, the researchers found no remissions, but none of the 48 patients treated had side effects serious enough to be placed under intensive hospital care, according to the article. In the second study, whose principal author is Dr. Steven Rosenberg of the National Cancer Institute, researchers administered IL-2 to 157 cancer patients and found a 33 pct remission rate in cancers of the kidney, a 27 pct rate in melanomas and a 15 pct rate in cancers of the colon and rectum. In the National Cancer Institute trials, a total of four patients died, the magazine reported, confirming the harshness of the drugs side effects as originally administered. Perhaps we are at the end of the beginning of the search for successful immunotherapy for cancer, said the editorial, signed by John Durant of Philadelphias Chase Cancer Center. These observations reported by Rosenberg and West surely did not describe successful practical approaches ready for widespread applications in the therapy of cancer patients, the editorial said. On the other hand, if they reflect, as seems possible, a successful manipulation of the cellular immune system, then we may be near the end of our search for a meaningful direction in the immunuotherapy of cancer, the editorial concluded.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Calif_Records	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Caproni_Vizzola_Calif

Miller	1043	1049	http://dbpedia.org/resource/James_C._Miller_III	Office of Management and Budget Director James Miller said President Reagan will reject the tax increase called for in the House Budget Committees 1988 budget proposal which is before the House for a vote today. Its just completely unacceptable, Miller told a House Appropriations subcommittee on Treasury, Postal Service and General Government Appropriations. The plan, drafted by the Democratic-controlled Budget committee, calls for 22 billion dlrs in higher revenues, of which 18 billion would be from new taxes set by the tax-writing committees. The House committees budget proposal includes some increases in federal user fees as well as 18 billion dlrs in taxes. Miller warned that failure to reduce the federal deficit would jeopardize the U.S. economy. If we do not further reduce the deficit... we place this economic expansion that weve had in the last five years at risk, Miller told the subcommittee. The result of any kind of tax increase would be to increase substantially the prospects that the expansion would come to an end, Miller said.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ronnie_Miller	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Jennifer_Miller	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Larry_Miller_(accordionist)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Miller,_Fulton_County,_Kentucky	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Allan_Miller_House	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Melissa_Scott-Miller	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Miller_Lake_(Nova_Scotia)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ross_Miller	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Kern_Miller	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Kenneth_P._Miller
London	1351	1357	http://dbpedia.org/resource/London	Exchanges and telecommunications authorities should abolish their restrictions on full and free dissemination of information to the investment and banking communities, Reuters Holdings Plc RTRS.L chairman Sir Christopher Hogg said. In the 1986 annual repoprt, he said lengthy negotiations had brought agreement with the Tokyo and London Stock Exchanges for fuller, but still not complete, access to market data through Reuter services. Many other markets maintain restrictions, he added. Hogg said members of some markets appear to believe that information restrictions protected their interests. In other cases, exchanges seem to be limiting the distribution of data in order to provide competitive advantage to their own commercial information businesses. He also noted that despite increasing liberalisation in the telecommunications field, some countries continue to protect their state monopolies at the expense of other economic sectors. Reuter dealing services remain excluded from such countries. As a result, banking communities serving entire economies are put at a competitive disadvantage, he added. Reuters increased its 1986 pre-tax profit by 39 pct from the previous year to 130.1 mln stg on a 43 pct rise in revenues to 620.9 mln stg. Earnings per ordinary share were up 47 pct to 19.4p.

A ministry spokesman said the unadjusted figures showed a smaller than usual seasonal decrease for the time of year, because of particularly cold weather delaying work in the building industry. He said this explained the increase in the adjusted statistics. Total vacancies available rose by 1,900 to 26,300 at end-March.

Tokyo	970	975	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tokyo	Britain intends to negotiate further agreements on international securities regulation to match those now in force with the U.S. And Japan, government sources said. The Department of Trade and Industry said earlier it had concluded a memorandum of understanding with Japans Finance Ministry to swap supervisory and investigatory information. The agreement covers stocks, shares and government bonds, but not commodity futures, whose regulation in Japan does not come under the Finance Ministry. It therefore does not cover some transactions on the London International Financial Futures Exchange and the London commodities and metal exchanges. The DTI said it hoped to seek further understandings with other countries which met in the U.K. Last December. The meeting involved delegates from the U.K., Switzerland, the U.S., Canada, Australia, Hong Kong, Japan, France, West Germany and Holland. Government sources said the deal with Japan completes arrangements linking Tokyo, the U.S. And London. A U.K. Agreement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) was signed last September. Todays agreement will deal with requests for information on a case by case basis, U.K. Government sources said. It is not legally binding and comes into force immediately.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Alvark_Tokyo	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tokyo_Metro_02_series	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tune_in_Tokyo_(band)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tokyo_Cabinet_and_Kyoto_Cabinet	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Minamitoshima_District,_Tokyo	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ochiai_Station_(Tokyo)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Minamiōizumi,_Nerima,_Tokyo	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tokyo_City_Nights	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Arakawa,_Tokyo	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Prudential_Tower_(Tokyo)
Boeing	989	995	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Boeing	Faulty repair work by The Boeing Company BA.N was a contributary cause to a Japan Air Lines Co Ltd JAPN.Y 747 crash on August 12, 1985, that killed 520 people, the final draft of a Ministry of Transport report says. There were only four survivors when the aircraft crashed into a mountain north of Tokyo. The report said inadequate inspection of the aircraft by Japanese inspectors after the repairs was another factor in the crash. The crew were cleared of any responsibility for the disaster. The report, which was sent on March 23 to the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board for comment, should be released in late May. Under an international convention the draft must be submitted for final comments to the relevant authorities. Boeing spokesmen were unavailable for comment. On April 4, a Boeing spokesman at the firms headquarters said the company would probably make no comment on the Japanese investigation teams report until it was officially released. On September 6, 1985, Boeing said in a statement that the 1978 repairs it had undertaken were faulty. This statement did not, however, connect the faulty repairs with the cause of the crash.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Boeing_strike_of_1948	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Boeing_C-17_Globemaster_III	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Boeing_B-50_Superfortress	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Boeing_T-43	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Boeing_367-80	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Boeing_OC-135B_Open_Skies	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Boeing_YB-40_Flying_Fortress	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Boeing_YC-14	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Boeing_Phantom_Works	http://dbpedia.org/resource/List_of_accidents_and_incidents_involving_the_Boeing_707
DD	3589	3591	http://dbpedia.org/resource/DuPont	Cheap oil feedstocks, the weakened U.S. dollar and a plant utilization rate approaching 90 pct will propel the streamlined U.S. petrochemical industry to record profits this year, with growth expected through at least 1990, major company executives predicted. This bullish outlook for chemical manufacturing and an industrywide move to shed unrelated businesses has prompted GAF Corp (GAF), privately-held Cain Chemical Inc, and other firms to aggressively seek acquisitions of petrochemical plants. Oil companies such as Ashland Oil Inc (ASH), the Kentucky-based oil refiner and marketer, are also shopping for money-making petrochemical businesses to buy. I see us poised at the threshold of a golden period, said Paul Oreffice, chairman of giant Dow Chemical Co (DOW), adding, Theres no major plant capacity being added around the world now. The whole game is bringing out new products and improving the old ones. Analysts say the chemical industrys biggest customers, automobile manufacturers and home builders that use a lot of paints and plastics, are expected to buy quantities this year. U.S. petrochemical plants are currently operating at about 90 pct capacity, reflecting tighter supply that could hike product prices by 30 to 40 pct this year, said John Dosher, managing director of Pace Consultants Inc of Houston. Demand for some products such as styrene could push profit margins up by as much as 300 pct, he said. Oreffice, speaking at a meeting of chemical engineers in Houston, said Dow would easily top the 741 mln dlrs it earned last year and predicted it would have the best year in its history. In 1985, when oil prices were still above 25 dlrs a barrel and chemical exports were adversely affected by the strong U.S. dollar, Dow had profits of 58 mln dlrs. I believe the entire chemical industry is headed for a record year or close to it, Oreffice said. GAF chairman Samuel Heyman estimated that the U.S. chemical industry would report a 20 pct gain in profits during 1987. Last year, the domestic industry earned a total of 13 billion dlrs, a 54 pct leap from 1985. The turn in the fortunes of the once-sickly chemical industry has been brought about by a combination of luck and planning, said Paces John Dosher. Dosher said last years fall in oil prices made feedstocks dramatically cheaper and at the same time the American dollar was weakening against foreign currencies. That helped boost U.S. chemical exports. Also helping to bring supply and demand into balance has been the gradual market absorption of the extra chemical manufacturing capacity created by Middle Eastern oil producers in the early 1980s. Finally, virtually all major U.S. chemical manufacturers have embarked on an extensive corporate restructuring program to mothball inefficient plants, trim the payroll and eliminate unrelated businesses. The restructuring touched off a flurry of friendly and hostile takeover attempts. GAF, which made an unsuccessful attempt in 1985 to acquire Union Carbide Corp UK, recently offered three billion dlrs for Borg Warner Corp BOR, a Chicago manufacturer of plastics and chemicals. Another industry powerhouse, W.R. Grace (GRA) has divested its retailing, restaurant and fertilizer businesses to raise cash for chemical acquisitions. But some experts worry that the chemical industry may be headed for trouble if companies continue turning their back on the manufacturing of staple petrochemical commodities, such as ethylene, in favor of more profitable specialty chemicals that are custom-designed for a small group of buyers. Companies like DuPont (DD) and Monsanto Co MTC spent the past two or three years trying to get out of the commodity chemical business in reaction to how badly the market had deteriorated, Dosher said. But I think they will eventually kill the margins on the profitable chemicals in the niche market. Some top chemical executives share the concern. The challenge for our industry is to keep from getting carried away and repeating past mistakes, GAFs Heyman cautioned. The shift from commodity chemicals may be ill-advised. Specialty businesses do not stay special long. Houston-based Cain Chemical, created this month by the Sterling investment banking group, believes it can generate 700 mln dlrs in annual sales by bucking the industry trend. Chairman Gordon Cain, who previously led a leveraged buyout of Duponts Conoco Incs chemical business, has spent 1.1 billion dlrs since January to buy seven petrochemical plants along the Texas Gulf Coast. The plants produce only basic commodity petrochemicals that are the building blocks of specialty products. This kind of commodity chemical business will never be a glamorous, high-margin business, Cain said, adding that demand is expected to grow by about three pct annually. Garo Armen, an analyst with Dean Witter Reynolds, said chemical makers have also benefitted by increasing demand for plastics as prices become more competitive with aluminum, wood and steel products. Armen estimated the upturn in the chemical business could last as long as four or five years, provided the U.S. economy continues its modest rate of growth.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/USS_Lawrence_(DD-8)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/USS_Shaw_(DD-373)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/USS_Yarnall_(DD-143)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/USS_Gregory_(DD-802)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/USS_Anderson_(DD-411)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/USS_Fletcher_(DD-445)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/USS_Macdonough_(DD-351)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/USS_Young_(DD-580)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/USS_Ross_(DD-563)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/USS_Monaghan_(DD-354)
Morgan	426	432	http://dbpedia.org/resource/J._P._Morgan	J.P. Morgan and Co Inc said its first-quarter earnings fell by 3.2 pct, largely reflecting its previously announced decision to place on non-accrual status its 1.3 billion dlrs of medium- and long-term loans to Brazil. That decision, spurred by Brazils suspension of interest payments on February 20, reduced the quarters net income by 20 mln dlrs to 226.4 mln dlrs, compared with 233.9 mln in the first three months of 1986. Morgan also reported a loss of 1.8 mln dlrs from securities underwriting and trading, in contrast to a gain of 45.4 mln dlrs in the year-earlier period. In the fourth quarter of 1986, Morgan posted other trading losses of 5.5 mln dlrs because of setbacks in the trading and underwriting of Euromarket securities. Conditions in some sectors of the Euromarket remained difficult last quarter, with floating rate notes suffering heavy price falls, but a spokeswoman was unable to say whether Morgans trading losses were restricted to the Euromarket. On the positive side, Morgan reduced its provision for loan losses to 35 mln dlrs from 70 mln a year earlier. Foreign exchange trading income rose to 82 mln dlrs from 72.6 mln and trust income increased to 95.9 mln dlrs from 75.9 mln. Morgan said other operating income, mainly fees and commissions, rose to 102.2 mln dlrs from 88.4 mln, but net investment securities gains dropped to 43.1 mln from 58.1 mln. Net interest earnings were 490.4 mln dlrs in the first quarter, down from 499.4 mln a year earlier, and net yield fell to 2.79 pct from 3.20 pct. If Brazil had not been placed on non-accrual, which means that interest can be recorded as income only when payments are actually received, net interest earnings would have been 525.9 mln dlrs and net yield 2.99 pct. If Brazil does not resume payments, 1987 net would be cut by 72 mln dlrs, Morgan added. After the provision for loan losses, Morgans allowance for credit losses at the end of March totaled 953 mln dlrs compared with 910 mln at end-1986 and 815 mln a year earlier. It reported net recoveries of six mln dlrs after charge-offs of eight mln, compared with net charge-offs of 49 mln dlrs after recoveries of three mln a year earlier. Excluding Brazil, non-accruing loans at quarters end were 583 mln dlrs, down from 633 mln at end-1986 and 684 mln a year earlier. Non-interest expenses rose to 371.1 mln dlrs from 303.5 mln dlrs, with more than half the increase related to personnel costs, Morgan said.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Paddy_Morgan	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Morgan_Yaeger	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Fieschi_Morgan_Staurotheke	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Corday-Morgan_Prize	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Morgan_Wade	http://dbpedia.org/resource/William_Wilson_Morgan	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Morgan-Gold_House	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Danny_Morgan_(politician)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Neal_Morgan,_Jr.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Morgan_Larson_(sailor)
Misiones	727	735	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Misiones_Province	Argentine grain producers adjusted their yield estimates for the 1986/87 coarse grain crop downward in the week to yesterday after the heavy rains at the end of March and beginning of April, trade sources said. They said sunflower, maize and sorghum production estimates had been reduced despite some later warm, dry weather, which has allowed a return to harvesting in some areas. However, as showers fell intermittently after last weekend, producers feared another spell of prolonged and intense rain could cause more damage to crops already badly hit this season. Rains in the middle of last week reached an average of 27 millimetres in parts of Buenos Aires province, 83 mm in Cordoba, 41 in Santa Fe, 50 in Entre Rios and Misiones, 95 in Corrientes, eight in Chaco and 35 in Formosa. There was no rainfall in the same period in La Pampa. Producers feared continued damp conditions could produce rotting and lead to still lower yield estimates for all the crops, including soybean. However, as the lands began drying later in the week harvesting advanced considerably, reaching between 36 and 40 pct of the area sown in the case of sunflower. Deterioration of the sunflower crop evident in harvested material in Cordoba, La Pampa and Buenos Aires forced yield estimates per hectare to be adjusted down again. The seasons sunflowerseed production is now forecast at 2.1 mln to 2.3 mln tonnes, against 2.2 mln to 2.4 mln forecast last week and down 43.9 to 48.8 pct on the 1985/86 record of 4.1 mln. Area sown to sunflowers was two to 2.2 mln hectares, 29.9 to 36.3 pct below the record 3.14 mln hectares last season. Maize harvesting has also reached 36 to 40 pct of the area sown. It is near completion in Cordoba and Santa Fe and will begin in La Pampa and southern Buenos Aires later in April. Production estimates for maize were down from last week at 9.5 mln to 9.8 mln tonnes, against 9.6 mln to 9.9 mln estimated previously. This is 22.2 to 23.4 pct below the 12.4 mln to 12.6 mln tonnes estimated by private sources for the 1985/86 crop and 21.9 to 25.8 pct down on the official figure of 12.8 mln tonnes. Maize was sown on 3.58 mln to 3.78 mln hectares, two to seven pct down on last seasons 3.85 mln. Sorghum was harvested on 23 to 25 pct of the area sown in Cordoba, Santa Fe and Chaco. Harvest will start in La Pampa and Buenos Aires in mid-April. The total area sown was 1.23 mln to 1.30 mln hectares, 10.3 to 15.2 pct down on the 1.45 mln sown last season. The new forecast for the sorghum crop is 2.9 mln to 3.2 mln tonnes compared with three mln to 3.3 mln forecast last week, and is 23.8 to 29.3 pct down on last seasons 4.1 mln to 4.2 mln tonne crop. The soybean crop for this season was not adjusted, remaining at a record 7.5 mln to 7.7 mln tonnes, up 4.2 to 5.5 pct on the 7.2 mln to 7.3 mln estimated by private sources for 1985/86 and 5.6 to 8.5 pct higher than the official figure of 7.1 mln. The area sown to soybeans this season was a record 3.7 mln to 3.8 mln hectares, 10.8 to 13.8 pct up on the record 3.34 mln sown in 1985/86. The soybean crop is showing excessive moisture in some areas and producers fear they may discover more damage. Some experimental harvesting was carried out in Santa Fe on areas making up only about one pct of the total crop but details on this were not available. Preparation of the fields for the 1987/88 wheat crop, which will be sown between May and August or September, has so far not been as intense as in previous years.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cerro_Corá_(Misiones)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bernardo_de_Irigoyen,_Misiones	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Montecarlo,_Misiones	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Nueve_de_Julio,_Misiones	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Loreto,_Misiones	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Misiones_Department	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Aristóbulo_del_Valle_(Misiones)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/San_José,_Misiones	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Misiones_Orientales	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Corpus,_Misiones

Dominion	588	596	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dominion_Textile	The largest U.S. textile maker focused on its own business as its competitors found merger partners, but now Burlington Industries Inc may have restructured itself into an attractive takeover candidate, analysts said. The takeover spotlight fell today on Burlington, which rose 4-7/8 to 52-7/8 on speculation that investor Asher Edelman and Dominion Textiles Inc of Canada bought an almost five pct stake. A published report said Edelman and Dominion jointly acquired a stake in Burlington and were weighing a takeover offer. Edelman would not comment, and a spokesman for Montreal-based Dominion called the report just rumors. Burlington said it did not know if the report was true. Wall Street professionals said they were not convinced of the story or that Edelman and Dominion would be the victors if Burlington actually came into play. Arbitragers said past comments from Dominion, however, added credence to the speculation. Dominion has said that it was looking for a takeover in the U.S. Last year, Dominion unsuccessfully bid for Avondale Mills and has maintained a 120 mln dlr line of credit to be used for a U.S. acquisition. A Dominion spokesman said Canadas largest textile producer has been negotiating with many U.S. textile companies, but would not say whether Burlington was among them. There have been acquisitions in this area. Its not unusual that someone could be looking at Burlington after the housecleaning theyve done, said Eileen Gormley of Thomson McKinnon. Burlington sold its domestic operations, which made sheets and other linens, to J.P. Stevens and Co Inc for 110 mln dlrs last year. It also has reorganized management, and focused its operations on businesses that would be less affected by foreign competition, Gormley said. Theyve pulled back so as not to be a commodity marketer, said Gormley. She said in moving more heavily into industrial fabrics, Burlington bought C.H. Masland, which supplies carpets and other fabric to the auto industry. In the past, they just spent and never realized the return on the outlays they did make, she said. You look at their record over the year, and I think theyre poised to be more profitable than they had been in the past, Gormley said. She estimated 1987 earnings of 2.50 dlrs per share, up from 2.01 dlrs per share. Some analysts today recommended clients not buy Burlington at its current levels. Edward Johnson of Johnson Redbook said he recommends selling. He said he believes the stock is worth only about 50 dlrs on a takeover basis and about 46 dlrs on an earnings basis. Some arbitragers, however, said takeover values have been placed on the company of 60 to 65 dlrs per share. After Ashers (Edelman) recent history, a lot of people dont find him very credible anymore, said one arbitrager. Another, however, said Edelman succeeds in forcing managements to take steps to enhance shareholder values even if he doesnt win the target company. Edelman was unsuccessful last year in offers for Lucky Stores Inc and Fruehauf Corp. He did succeed in buying Ponderosa Inc. The stocks of other textile makers rose along with Burlington. J.P. Stevens STN climbed 5/8 to 44-7/8, and Fieldcrest Cannon Inc FLD, the result of a merger of Fieldcrest and Cannon, rose 1-1/8 to 39-3/4. West Point-Pepperell Inc WPM rose 1-7/8 to 67-1/8.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dominion_Diamond_Corporation	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dominion_Bridge_Company	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Old_Dominion_Glass_Company	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dominions_3:_The_Awakening	http://dbpedia.org/resource/2011_The_Dominion_Tankard	http://dbpedia.org/resource/HMS_Dominion_(1903)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Kings_Dominion	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dominion_Enterprises	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Phase_3:_Thrones_and_Dominions	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dominion_7.5_in_Osaka-jo_Hall
Rio Grande do Sul	630	647	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Rio_Grande_do_Sul	Storage problems with Brazils record grain crop are likely to result in losses of about five mln tonnes, an Agriculture Ministry spokesman said. Ministry spokesman Leonardo Brito, speaking from Brasilia, told Reuters he believed that about five mln tonnes of this years estimated crop of 65 mln tonnes would be lost. He said part of this would be the normal loss inevitable in harvesting, but that most of it would stem from storage problems. Brazil has a storage capacity of 66 mln tonnes, theoretically sufficient for the crop. But Brito said that the storage capacity was badly distributed. The states of Sao Paulo, Parana and Rio Grande do Sul had between them 70 pct of the nations capacity, but were responsible for only 50 to 60 pct of production. The biggest problems are concentrated in the Centre-West growing regions, where rising production has outpaced storage capacity. Brito said the Centre-West, whose crops include soya and maize, had between 30 and 40 pct of the nations grains production but only 20 pct of its storage space. In addition to the poor distribution of storage units, there is the problem that too much of the capacity is geared to storing grain in sacks, while not enough is suitable for storing loose grain, Brito said. Finally, there is a shortage of lorries to transport the crops. The sheer scale of the task in transporting the record crop has been evident from television reports, which have shown enormous queues of lorries waiting outside granaries.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ponta_do_Seixas	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Grande_Fratello_(season_11)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cemitério_do_Morumbi	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Do_You_Feel_Like_Breaking_Up%3F	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Do_You_Hear_What_I_Hear%3F	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sergio_Dos_Santos	http://dbpedia.org/resource/São_João_(Lajes_do_Pico)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Do_No_Harm_(TV_series)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Esperança_do_Sul	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Kia_Rio
Cetus Corp	335	345	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cetus_Corporation	Promising new findings in the use of a controversial experimental drug called Interleukin-2 as a cure for cancer will be published in the April 9 issue of the prestigious New England Journal of Medicine, according to a Wall Street analyst who has obtained an advance copy of the magazine. Among interleukins principal U. S. makers are Cetus Corp CTUS, headquartered in Emeryville, Calif., and Immunex Corp IMNX, based in Seattle, Wash. The journal, to be released late today, contains two articles reporting high remission rates several cancer types. The journal also contains a signed editorial concluding that the new results mark a significant milestone in the search for a successful immunotherapy for cancer. Interleukin-2, also known as IL-2, is a substance naturally produced by living cells in the laboratory. The drug is controversial because it was widely praised as a promising cancer treatment in early reports on its effectiveness in late 1985, only to come under criticism a year later for its failure to live up to its promise and due to its ravaging side effects. One of the new studies, conducted by Dr. William West of Biotherapeutics Inc of Franklin, Tenn., is particularly significant because it found far fewer harsh side effects after it changed the way in which the drug is administered. In that study, researchers administered IL-2 to 48 cancer patients and found a 50-pct remission rate for kidney cancers and a 50 pct remission rate for melanoma, a type of skin cancer, according to Prudential-Bache Securities Stuart Weisbrod, who obtained the advance copy of the magazine. For rectal and colon cancer, the researchers found no remissions, but none of the 48 patients treated had side effects serious enough to be placed under intensive hospital care, according to the article. In the second study, whose principal author is Dr. Steven Rosenberg of the National Cancer Institute, researchers administered IL-2 to 157 cancer patients and found a 33 pct remission rate in cancers of the kidney, a 27 pct rate in melanomas and a 15 pct rate in cancers of the colon and rectum. In the National Cancer Institute trials, a total of four patients died, the magazine reported, confirming the harshness of the drugs side effects as originally administered. Perhaps we are at the end of the beginning of the search for successful immunotherapy for cancer, said the editorial, signed by John Durant of Philadelphias Chase Cancer Center. These observations reported by Rosenberg and West surely did not describe successful practical approaches ready for widespread applications in the therapy of cancer patients, the editorial said. On the other hand, if they reflect, as seems possible, a successful manipulation of the cellular immune system, then we may be near the end of our search for a meaningful direction in the immunuotherapy of cancer, the editorial concluded.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/General_Dynamics_Corp._v._United_States	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Aspres-lès-Corps	http://dbpedia.org/resource/6th_Army_Corps_(Ukraine)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/The_Pacemakers_Drum_and_Bugle_Corps	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Volunteer_Air_Observers_Corps_(Australia)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/XIV_Panzer_Corps	http://dbpedia.org/resource/II_Corps_(Union_Army)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Infantry_Corps_(Israel)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cetus_Dwarf	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Colt_Cadets_Drum_and_Bugle_Corps
DOW	766	769	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dow_Chemical_Company	Cheap oil feedstocks, the weakened U.S. dollar and a plant utilization rate approaching 90 pct will propel the streamlined U.S. petrochemical industry to record profits this year, with growth expected through at least 1990, major company executives predicted. This bullish outlook for chemical manufacturing and an industrywide move to shed unrelated businesses has prompted GAF Corp (GAF), privately-held Cain Chemical Inc, and other firms to aggressively seek acquisitions of petrochemical plants. Oil companies such as Ashland Oil Inc (ASH), the Kentucky-based oil refiner and marketer, are also shopping for money-making petrochemical businesses to buy. I see us poised at the threshold of a golden period, said Paul Oreffice, chairman of giant Dow Chemical Co (DOW), adding, Theres no major plant capacity being added around the world now. The whole game is bringing out new products and improving the old ones. Analysts say the chemical industrys biggest customers, automobile manufacturers and home builders that use a lot of paints and plastics, are expected to buy quantities this year. U.S. petrochemical plants are currently operating at about 90 pct capacity, reflecting tighter supply that could hike product prices by 30 to 40 pct this year, said John Dosher, managing director of Pace Consultants Inc of Houston. Demand for some products such as styrene could push profit margins up by as much as 300 pct, he said. Oreffice, speaking at a meeting of chemical engineers in Houston, said Dow would easily top the 741 mln dlrs it earned last year and predicted it would have the best year in its history. In 1985, when oil prices were still above 25 dlrs a barrel and chemical exports were adversely affected by the strong U.S. dollar, Dow had profits of 58 mln dlrs. I believe the entire chemical industry is headed for a record year or close to it, Oreffice said. GAF chairman Samuel Heyman estimated that the U.S. chemical industry would report a 20 pct gain in profits during 1987. Last year, the domestic industry earned a total of 13 billion dlrs, a 54 pct leap from 1985. The turn in the fortunes of the once-sickly chemical industry has been brought about by a combination of luck and planning, said Paces John Dosher. Dosher said last years fall in oil prices made feedstocks dramatically cheaper and at the same time the American dollar was weakening against foreign currencies. That helped boost U.S. chemical exports. Also helping to bring supply and demand into balance has been the gradual market absorption of the extra chemical manufacturing capacity created by Middle Eastern oil producers in the early 1980s. Finally, virtually all major U.S. chemical manufacturers have embarked on an extensive corporate restructuring program to mothball inefficient plants, trim the payroll and eliminate unrelated businesses. The restructuring touched off a flurry of friendly and hostile takeover attempts. GAF, which made an unsuccessful attempt in 1985 to acquire Union Carbide Corp UK, recently offered three billion dlrs for Borg Warner Corp BOR, a Chicago manufacturer of plastics and chemicals. Another industry powerhouse, W.R. Grace (GRA) has divested its retailing, restaurant and fertilizer businesses to raise cash for chemical acquisitions. But some experts worry that the chemical industry may be headed for trouble if companies continue turning their back on the manufacturing of staple petrochemical commodities, such as ethylene, in favor of more profitable specialty chemicals that are custom-designed for a small group of buyers. Companies like DuPont (DD) and Monsanto Co MTC spent the past two or three years trying to get out of the commodity chemical business in reaction to how badly the market had deteriorated, Dosher said. But I think they will eventually kill the margins on the profitable chemicals in the niche market. Some top chemical executives share the concern. The challenge for our industry is to keep from getting carried away and repeating past mistakes, GAFs Heyman cautioned. The shift from commodity chemicals may be ill-advised. Specialty businesses do not stay special long. Houston-based Cain Chemical, created this month by the Sterling investment banking group, believes it can generate 700 mln dlrs in annual sales by bucking the industry trend. Chairman Gordon Cain, who previously led a leveraged buyout of Duponts Conoco Incs chemical business, has spent 1.1 billion dlrs since January to buy seven petrochemical plants along the Texas Gulf Coast. The plants produce only basic commodity petrochemicals that are the building blocks of specialty products. This kind of commodity chemical business will never be a glamorous, high-margin business, Cain said, adding that demand is expected to grow by about three pct annually. Garo Armen, an analyst with Dean Witter Reynolds, said chemical makers have also benefitted by increasing demand for plastics as prices become more competitive with aluminum, wood and steel products. Armen estimated the upturn in the chemical business could last as long as four or five years, provided the U.S. economy continues its modest rate of growth.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thomas_Millie_Dow	http://dbpedia.org/resource/1990_Dow_Classic_–_Doubles	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cora_Dow	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Edward_Dow_(architect)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ruth_Dow	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Alden_B._Dow	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tony_Dow	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dow_H._Drukker	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Frankfort_Dow_Memorial_Field	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Lenoir_Dow_House
SFE	527	530	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Australian_Securities_Exchange	The Victorian Corporate Affairs Commission, CAC, said it had suspended the futures trading licence of G H Shintoh (Australia) Ltd after a receiver was appointed to the companys South Australian branch. The one month suspension followed consultation with the Sydney Futures Exchange, SFE, which was liaising with Shintoh concerning the open positions of its clients, the CAC said. The South Australian CAC had applied for the appointment of a receiver and manager over the Adelaide office of Shintoh, an associate member of the SFE, the CAC said. Shintohs is the first licence suspended under a Futures Industry Code introduced by Australian states from July 1, 1986, SFE chief executive Les Hosking told Reuters.

Burlington	3104	3114	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Burlington_Industries	The largest U.S. textile maker focused on its own business as its competitors found merger partners, but now Burlington Industries Inc may have restructured itself into an attractive takeover candidate, analysts said. The takeover spotlight fell today on Burlington, which rose 4-7/8 to 52-7/8 on speculation that investor Asher Edelman and Dominion Textiles Inc of Canada bought an almost five pct stake. A published report said Edelman and Dominion jointly acquired a stake in Burlington and were weighing a takeover offer. Edelman would not comment, and a spokesman for Montreal-based Dominion called the report just rumors. Burlington said it did not know if the report was true. Wall Street professionals said they were not convinced of the story or that Edelman and Dominion would be the victors if Burlington actually came into play. Arbitragers said past comments from Dominion, however, added credence to the speculation. Dominion has said that it was looking for a takeover in the U.S. Last year, Dominion unsuccessfully bid for Avondale Mills and has maintained a 120 mln dlr line of credit to be used for a U.S. acquisition. A Dominion spokesman said Canadas largest textile producer has been negotiating with many U.S. textile companies, but would not say whether Burlington was among them. There have been acquisitions in this area. Its not unusual that someone could be looking at Burlington after the housecleaning theyve done, said Eileen Gormley of Thomson McKinnon.

Volkswagen AG	0	13	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Volkswagen_Group	Volkswagen AG VOWG.F, VW, is due to make a formal announcement about its 1986 dividend tomorrow after saying the 1985 level of 10 marks per ordinary share would be held, despite massive losses because of a suspected foreign currency fraud. A spokesman said VWs supervisory board will meet tomorrow to discuss the payout. A statement will be made afterwards. VW has also said disclosed profits for 1986 will reach their 1985 level, despite provisions of a possible 480 mln marks linked to the currency affair. The figure is virtually the same as the 477 mln mark 1985 parent company net profit. When VW first confirmed the currency scandal on March 10 it said the management board would propose an unchanged 10-mark dividend to the supervisory board. A dividend of 11 marks would be proposed for the companys new preference shares. Share analysts said they saw supervisory board approval of the management board proposal as virtually a formality. Anything else would be more than a surprise, one said. Company sources said VW would have to dig into reserves to maintain the disclosed profit. Parent company reserves stood at around three billion marks at end-1985.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Edmonton_Journal_v_Alberta_(AG)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Volkswagen_emissions_scandal	http://dbpedia.org/resource/USNS_Sgt._Curtis_F._Shoup_(T-AG-175)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Volkswagen_Kübelwagen	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bito_AG	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Volkswagen_Golf_Mk4	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Volkswagen_Passat_(B4)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Schenker_AG	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Volkswagen_Foundation	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Volkswagen_air-cooled_engine

Georgia Power	1209	1222	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Georgia_Power	An audit submitted to the Georgia Public Service Commission claims that between 944 mln dlrs and 1.8 billion dlrs of the costs of the Plant Vogtle nuclear power station should be disallowed, a Southern Co spokeswoman said. Southerns Georgia Power Co subsidiary has a 45.7 pct interest in the plant and estimated earlier this year it would cost a total of 8.87 billion dlrs. Last year, the plants owners pledged to Georgia regulators they would limit the cost passed on to rate payers to 8.4 billion dlrs. The Southern spokeswoman said the company feels the report by OBrien-Kreitzberg is flawed and biased. She said the report was released yesterday by the state attorney general. Responding to the report today, Georgia Power Chairman Robert W. Scherer told a news conference the conclusions drawn by the firm are not only wrong -- they also reflect the same bias against nuclear power that these auditors have demonstrated in similar cases accross the country. Saying he was not suggesting Georgia power was without fault, Scherer said the audit identified several things I wish we had done differently. Scherer pointed out a report OBrien-Kreitzberg submitted to Georgia regulators in March 1986 projected Georgia Power would not finish Plant Vogtle unit one before the end of 1987. Noting unit one is finished, and we expect it to be in commercial operationg by June, he said the firms latest report ignored the earlier projection, gave the utility no credit for the completion and actually penalized us by suggesting that costs to maintain t he schedule be disallowed. Scherer said the latest audit alleges Georgia Power could have saved 95 mln dlrs if it had stopped using four shifts, seven days a week to speed construction three years sooner. He said this would have delayed completion of the plant for another year and it would have cost several hunderd million dlrs more.

Kentucky	549	557	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Kentucky	Cheap oil feedstocks, the weakened U.S. dollar and a plant utilization rate approaching 90 pct will propel the streamlined U.S. petrochemical industry to record profits this year, with growth expected through at least 1990, major company executives predicted. This bullish outlook for chemical manufacturing and an industrywide move to shed unrelated businesses has prompted GAF Corp (GAF), privately-held Cain Chemical Inc, and other firms to aggressively seek acquisitions of petrochemical plants. Oil companies such as Ashland Oil Inc (ASH), the Kentucky-based oil refiner and marketer, are also shopping for money-making petrochemical businesses to buy. I see us poised at the threshold of a golden period, said Paul Oreffice, chairman of giant Dow Chemical Co (DOW), adding, Theres no major plant capacity being added around the world now. The whole game is bringing out new products and improving the old ones. Analysts say the chemical industrys biggest customers, automobile manufacturers and home builders that use a lot of paints and plastics, are expected to buy quantities this year. U.S. petrochemical plants are currently operating at about 90 pct capacity, reflecting tighter supply that could hike product prices by 30 to 40 pct this year, said John Dosher, managing director of Pace Consultants Inc of Houston. Demand for some products such as styrene could push profit margins up by as much as 300 pct, he said. Oreffice, speaking at a meeting of chemical engineers in Houston, said Dow would easily top the 741 mln dlrs it earned last year and predicted it would have the best year in its history. In 1985, when oil prices were still above 25 dlrs a barrel and chemical exports were adversely affected by the strong U.S. dollar, Dow had profits of 58 mln dlrs. I believe the entire chemical industry is headed for a record year or close to it, Oreffice said. GAF chairman Samuel Heyman estimated that the U.S. chemical industry would report a 20 pct gain in profits during 1987. Last year, the domestic industry earned a total of 13 billion dlrs, a 54 pct leap from 1985. The turn in the fortunes of the once-sickly chemical industry has been brought about by a combination of luck and planning, said Paces John Dosher. Dosher said last years fall in oil prices made feedstocks dramatically cheaper and at the same time the American dollar was weakening against foreign currencies. That helped boost U.S. chemical exports. Also helping to bring supply and demand into balance has been the gradual market absorption of the extra chemical manufacturing capacity created by Middle Eastern oil producers in the early 1980s. Finally, virtually all major U.S. chemical manufacturers have embarked on an extensive corporate restructuring program to mothball inefficient plants, trim the payroll and eliminate unrelated businesses. The restructuring touched off a flurry of friendly and hostile takeover attempts. GAF, which made an unsuccessful attempt in 1985 to acquire Union Carbide Corp UK, recently offered three billion dlrs for Borg Warner Corp BOR, a Chicago manufacturer of plastics and chemicals. Another industry powerhouse, W.R. Grace (GRA) has divested its retailing, restaurant and fertilizer businesses to raise cash for chemical acquisitions. But some experts worry that the chemical industry may be headed for trouble if companies continue turning their back on the manufacturing of staple petrochemical commodities, such as ethylene, in favor of more profitable specialty chemicals that are custom-designed for a small group of buyers. Companies like DuPont (DD) and Monsanto Co MTC spent the past two or three years trying to get out of the commodity chemical business in reaction to how badly the market had deteriorated, Dosher said. But I think they will eventually kill the margins on the profitable chemicals in the niche market. Some top chemical executives share the concern. The challenge for our industry is to keep from getting carried away and repeating past mistakes, GAFs Heyman cautioned. The shift from commodity chemicals may be ill-advised. Specialty businesses do not stay special long. Houston-based Cain Chemical, created this month by the Sterling investment banking group, believes it can generate 700 mln dlrs in annual sales by bucking the industry trend. Chairman Gordon Cain, who previously led a leveraged buyout of Duponts Conoco Incs chemical business, has spent 1.1 billion dlrs since January to buy seven petrochemical plants along the Texas Gulf Coast. The plants produce only basic commodity petrochemicals that are the building blocks of specialty products. This kind of commodity chemical business will never be a glamorous, high-margin business, Cain said, adding that demand is expected to grow by about three pct annually. Garo Armen, an analyst with Dean Witter Reynolds, said chemical makers have also benefitted by increasing demand for plastics as prices become more competitive with aluminum, wood and steel products. Armen estimated the upturn in the chemical business could last as long as four or five years, provided the U.S. economy continues its modest rate of growth.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Holland,_Kentucky	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Western_Kentucky_Parkway	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Five_Forks,_Kentucky	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Harbell,_Bell_County,_Kentucky	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Viper,_Kentucky	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Public_schools_in_Louisville,_Kentucky	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Rabbit_Town,_Kentucky	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hardburly,_Kentucky	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Kentucky_Route_1519	http://dbpedia.org/resource/National_Register_of_Historic_Places_listings_in_Morgan_County,_Kentucky

Netherlands	560	571	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Netherlands	Roughly half of this years expected 130,000 hectare Dutch sugar beet crop is already in the ground, a spokesman for Suiker Unie, the largest sugar processor in the Netherlands, told Reuters. Conditions are generally good and the average sowing date for the crop is expected to be around April 11, against April 23 last year, and a 10-year average of April 14, the spokesman added. It is far too early yet to say what kind of output we can expect when it comes to harvest in September, but at least the crop is off to a very good start, he said. Last year, the Netherlands planted a record 137,600 hectares of sugar beet and produced a record 1.2 mln tonnes of white sugar, substantially more than the countrys combined A and B quota of 872,000 tonnes. This year, however, a self-imposed quota system has been introduced with the aim of cutting plantings to 130,000 hectares and reducing white sugar output to around 915,000 tonnes to minimise the amount of non-quota C sugar produced. Only farmers with a record of growing suger beet have been allotted quotas. This is expected to prevent the area being boosted by dairy or cereal farmers moving into sugar.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Best,_Netherlands	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Library_of_Congress_Classification:Class_D,_subclass_DJ_--_History_of_the_Netherlands	http://dbpedia.org/resource/States_General_of_the_Netherlands	http://dbpedia.org/resource/List_of_titles_and_honours_of_Beatrix_of_the_Netherlands	http://dbpedia.org/resource/List_of_universities_in_the_Netherlands_Antilles	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Netherlands_Open_Air_Museum	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Fox_Sports_International_(Netherlands)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/List_of_hospitals_in_the_Netherlands	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Netherlands_in_the_Junior_Eurovision_Song_Contest_2011	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Old_Catholic_Church_of_the_Netherlands
Miller	670	676	http://dbpedia.org/resource/James_C._Miller_III	Office of Management and Budget Director James Miller said President Reagan will reject the tax increase called for in the House Budget Committees 1988 budget proposal which is before the House for a vote today. Its just completely unacceptable, Miller told a House Appropriations subcommittee on Treasury, Postal Service and General Government Appropriations. The plan, drafted by the Democratic-controlled Budget committee, calls for 22 billion dlrs in higher revenues, of which 18 billion would be from new taxes set by the tax-writing committees. The House committees budget proposal includes some increases in federal user fees as well as 18 billion dlrs in taxes. Miller warned that failure to reduce the federal deficit would jeopardize the U.S. economy. If we do not further reduce the deficit... we place this economic expansion that weve had in the last five years at risk, Miller told the subcommittee. The result of any kind of tax increase would be to increase substantially the prospects that the expansion would come to an end, Miller said.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Fred_Miller_(American_football,_born_1973)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Steve_Miller_(American_football)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Stephen_Miller_House	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Georges_Miller	http://dbpedia.org/resource/John_Miller_(St_Mirren_footballer)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Brad_Miller_(baseball)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Eric_J._Miller	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Miller_Park_(Omaha,_Nebraska)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/John_Miller_(linebacker)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Jimmy_Miller_(American_football)
Burlington	1485	1495	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Burlington_Industries	The largest U.S. textile maker focused on its own business as its competitors found merger partners, but now Burlington Industries Inc may have restructured itself into an attractive takeover candidate, analysts said. The takeover spotlight fell today on Burlington, which rose 4-7/8 to 52-7/8 on speculation that investor Asher Edelman and Dominion Textiles Inc of Canada bought an almost five pct stake. A published report said Edelman and Dominion jointly acquired a stake in Burlington and were weighing a takeover offer. Edelman would not comment, and a spokesman for Montreal-based Dominion called the report just rumors. Burlington said it did not know if the report was true. Wall Street professionals said they were not convinced of the story or that Edelman and Dominion would be the victors if Burlington actually came into play. Arbitragers said past comments from Dominion, however, added credence to the speculation. Dominion has said that it was looking for a takeover in the U.S. Last year, Dominion unsuccessfully bid for Avondale Mills and has maintained a 120 mln dlr line of credit to be used for a U.S. acquisition. A Dominion spokesman said Canadas largest textile producer has been negotiating with many U.S. textile companies, but would not say whether Burlington was among them. There have been acquisitions in this area. Its not unusual that someone could be looking at Burlington after the housecleaning theyve done, said Eileen Gormley of Thomson McKinnon. Burlington sold its domestic operations, which made sheets and other linens, to J.P. Stevens and Co Inc for 110 mln dlrs last year. It also has reorganized management, and focused its operations on businesses that would be less affected by foreign competition, Gormley said. Theyve pulled back so as not to be a commodity marketer, said Gormley. She said in moving more heavily into industrial fabrics, Burlington bought C.H. Masland, which supplies carpets and other fabric to the auto industry. In the past, they just spent and never realized the return on the outlays they did make, she said. You look at their record over the year, and I think theyre poised to be more profitable than they had been in the past, Gormley said. She estimated 1987 earnings of 2.50 dlrs per share, up from 2.01 dlrs per share. Some analysts today recommended clients not buy Burlington at its current levels. Edward Johnson of Johnson Redbook said he recommends selling. He said he believes the stock is worth only about 50 dlrs on a takeover basis and about 46 dlrs on an earnings basis. Some arbitragers, however, said takeover values have been placed on the company of 60 to 65 dlrs per share. After Ashers (Edelman) recent history, a lot of people dont find him very credible anymore, said one arbitrager. Another, however, said Edelman succeeds in forcing managements to take steps to enhance shareholder values even if he doesnt win the target company. Edelman was unsuccessful last year in offers for Lucky Stores Inc and Fruehauf Corp. He did succeed in buying Ponderosa Inc. The stocks of other textile makers rose along with Burlington. J.P. Stevens STN climbed 5/8 to 44-7/8, and Fieldcrest Cannon Inc FLD, the result of a merger of Fieldcrest and Cannon, rose 1-1/8 to 39-3/4.

CME	585	588	http://dbpedia.org/resource/CME_Group	The Chicago Mercantile Exchange, CME, said it has added a new chief compliance officer and will expand its regulatory surveillance program. Paul OKelly, currently assistant regional administrator of the Securities and Exchange Commission, was named vice-president of compliance for the exchange, the CME said. The expanded compliance program, which calls for an increase in the exchanges compliance budget and addition of staff, was in response to recent criticisms that the CMEs current surveillance was not able to keep up with increased demands of recent volatility and volume, the CME said. The new surveillance program calls for the addition of three floor investigators and five compliance investigators, the CME said. Some of the new staff will monitor the exchanges new Computerized Trade Reconstruction system, scheduled to start July 1. In addition, three computer programmers will be added to assist in regulatory support for the exchanges management information system department. Recent criticism has been especially directed at the CMEs Standard and Poors stock index futures and options division. A special membership referendum to prohibit CME members from filling customer orders and trading for their own account in S and P 500 futures and options will be voted on April 13. In a letter dated March 12, CME chairman John Sandner and Executive committee chairman Leo Melamed urged members to reject the referendum in favor a series of new rules. Included in the rule changes was the requirement that futures brokers in the S and P pit manually record all personal trades to the nearest minute, intended to enhance the effectiveness of surveillance and compliance functions, We made a promise to our members that we have kept, Melamed said in a release today. He said the new surveillance program represents a commitment to a vigorous enforcement policy.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/2014_CME_Group_Tour_Championship	http://dbpedia.org/resource/2013_CME_Group_Titleholders	http://dbpedia.org/resource/2016_CME_Group_Tour_Championship	http://dbpedia.org/resource/CME_SPAN	http://dbpedia.org/resource/CME_Group_Tour_Championship	http://dbpedia.org/resource/2012_CME_Group_Titleholders	http://dbpedia.org/resource/2011_CME_Group_Titleholders	http://dbpedia.org/resource/2015_CME_Group_Tour_Championship	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Phillips_Chapel_CME_Church

The Department of Trade and Industry said earlier it had concluded a memorandum of understanding with Japans Finance Ministry to swap supervisory and investigatory information. The agreement covers stocks, shares and government bonds, but not commodity futures, whose regulation in Japan does not come under the Finance Ministry. It therefore does not cover some transactions on the London International Financial Futures Exchange and the London commodities and metal exchanges. The DTI said it hoped to seek further understandings with other countries which met in the U.K. Last December. The meeting involved delegates from the U.K., Switzerland, the U.S., Canada, Australia, Hong Kong, Japan, France, West Germany and Holland. Government sources said the deal with Japan completes arrangements linking Tokyo, the U.S. And London. A U.K. Agreement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) was signed last September.

Some arbitragers, however, said takeover values have been placed on the company of 60 to 65 dlrs per share. After Ashers (Edelman) recent history, a lot of people dont find him very credible anymore, said one arbitrager. Another, however, said Edelman succeeds in forcing managements to take steps to enhance shareholder values even if he doesnt win the target company. Edelman was unsuccessful last year in offers for Lucky Stores Inc and Fruehauf Corp. He did succeed in buying Ponderosa Inc. The stocks of other textile makers rose along with Burlington. J.P. Stevens STN climbed 5/8 to 44-7/8, and Fieldcrest Cannon Inc FLD, the result of a merger of Fieldcrest and Cannon, rose 1-1/8 to 39-3/4.

Texas Gulf Coast	4498	4514	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Gulf_Coast_of_the_United_States	Cheap oil feedstocks, the weakened U.S. dollar and a plant utilization rate approaching 90 pct will propel the streamlined U.S. petrochemical industry to record profits this year, with growth expected through at least 1990, major company executives predicted. This bullish outlook for chemical manufacturing and an industrywide move to shed unrelated businesses has prompted GAF Corp (GAF), privately-held Cain Chemical Inc, and other firms to aggressively seek acquisitions of petrochemical plants. Oil companies such as Ashland Oil Inc (ASH), the Kentucky-based oil refiner and marketer, are also shopping for money-making petrochemical businesses to buy. I see us poised at the threshold of a golden period, said Paul Oreffice, chairman of giant Dow Chemical Co (DOW), adding, Theres no major plant capacity being added around the world now. The whole game is bringing out new products and improving the old ones. Analysts say the chemical industrys biggest customers, automobile manufacturers and home builders that use a lot of paints and plastics, are expected to buy quantities this year. U.S. petrochemical plants are currently operating at about 90 pct capacity, reflecting tighter supply that could hike product prices by 30 to 40 pct this year, said John Dosher, managing director of Pace Consultants Inc of Houston. Demand for some products such as styrene could push profit margins up by as much as 300 pct, he said. Oreffice, speaking at a meeting of chemical engineers in Houston, said Dow would easily top the 741 mln dlrs it earned last year and predicted it would have the best year in its history. In 1985, when oil prices were still above 25 dlrs a barrel and chemical exports were adversely affected by the strong U.S. dollar, Dow had profits of 58 mln dlrs. I believe the entire chemical industry is headed for a record year or close to it, Oreffice said. GAF chairman Samuel Heyman estimated that the U.S. chemical industry would report a 20 pct gain in profits during 1987. Last year, the domestic industry earned a total of 13 billion dlrs, a 54 pct leap from 1985. The turn in the fortunes of the once-sickly chemical industry has been brought about by a combination of luck and planning, said Paces John Dosher. Dosher said last years fall in oil prices made feedstocks dramatically cheaper and at the same time the American dollar was weakening against foreign currencies. That helped boost U.S. chemical exports. Also helping to bring supply and demand into balance has been the gradual market absorption of the extra chemical manufacturing capacity created by Middle Eastern oil producers in the early 1980s. Finally, virtually all major U.S. chemical manufacturers have embarked on an extensive corporate restructuring program to mothball inefficient plants, trim the payroll and eliminate unrelated businesses. The restructuring touched off a flurry of friendly and hostile takeover attempts. GAF, which made an unsuccessful attempt in 1985 to acquire Union Carbide Corp UK, recently offered three billion dlrs for Borg Warner Corp BOR, a Chicago manufacturer of plastics and chemicals. Another industry powerhouse, W.R. Grace (GRA) has divested its retailing, restaurant and fertilizer businesses to raise cash for chemical acquisitions. But some experts worry that the chemical industry may be headed for trouble if companies continue turning their back on the manufacturing of staple petrochemical commodities, such as ethylene, in favor of more profitable specialty chemicals that are custom-designed for a small group of buyers. Companies like DuPont (DD) and Monsanto Co MTC spent the past two or three years trying to get out of the commodity chemical business in reaction to how badly the market had deteriorated, Dosher said. But I think they will eventually kill the margins on the profitable chemicals in the niche market. Some top chemical executives share the concern. The challenge for our industry is to keep from getting carried away and repeating past mistakes, GAFs Heyman cautioned. The shift from commodity chemicals may be ill-advised. Specialty businesses do not stay special long. Houston-based Cain Chemical, created this month by the Sterling investment banking group, believes it can generate 700 mln dlrs in annual sales by bucking the industry trend. Chairman Gordon Cain, who previously led a leveraged buyout of Duponts Conoco Incs chemical business, has spent 1.1 billion dlrs since January to buy seven petrochemical plants along the Texas Gulf Coast. The plants produce only basic commodity petrochemicals that are the building blocks of specialty products. This kind of commodity chemical business will never be a glamorous, high-margin business, Cain said, adding that demand is expected to grow by about three pct annually. Garo Armen, an analyst with Dean Witter Reynolds, said chemical makers have also benefitted by increasing demand for plastics as prices become more competitive with aluminum, wood and steel products. Armen estimated the upturn in the chemical business could last as long as four or five years, provided the U.S. economy continues its modest rate of growth.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Coast_Guard_Museum_Northwest	http://dbpedia.org/resource/2014_Castrol_Edge_Gold_Coast_600	http://dbpedia.org/resource/1985_Texas_A&M_Aggies_football_team	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Texas_Tech_Red_Raiders_football_under_Jerry_Moore	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Baylor–Texas_Tech_football_rivalry	http://dbpedia.org/resource/1966_Texas_Longhorns_football_team	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Gulf_of_Suez	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Texas_State_Highway_36	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bluetown,_Texas	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Gulf_Cup_of_Nations_Under_23
Reagan	303	309	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ronald_Reagan	A Treasury official said there are no plans to try to reduce the U.S. budget deficit by issuing yen-denominated bonds that would become known as Reagan bonds. It simply isnt something that we are planning to do, the official said. He added the Treasury was aware of Japanese news reports suggesting the Reagan administration might issue such bonds as the former Carter administration did when it sold Carter bonds denominated in West German marks. But he said the situation was greatly different now. If you look at the differences between the treasury market now and in the Carter administration years, it is a much more global market now, the official said. There was not the same ease then for the holder of another currency to buy other countries securities, he added, But there is no difficulty now for them to purchase dollars and buy U.S. securities. The United States needs dollars, not Japanese yen, to pay its debts and reduce the deficit and so has no plans to issue yen-denominated bonds, he emphasized.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bruce_V._Reagan	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Reagan_Field	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Reagan_Campbell-Gillard	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ronald_Reagan_Monument_(Warsaw)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Reagan_Gomez-Preston	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dutch:_A_Memoir_of_Ronald_Reagan	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Reagan_County_Independent_School_District	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ronald_Reagan_Washington_National_Airport	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ronald_Reagan_High_School_(San_Antonio)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Reagan_Dunn

CME	715	718	http://dbpedia.org/resource/CME_Group	The Chicago Mercantile Exchange, CME, said it has added a new chief compliance officer and will expand its regulatory surveillance program. Paul OKelly, currently assistant regional administrator of the Securities and Exchange Commission, was named vice-president of compliance for the exchange, the CME said. The expanded compliance program, which calls for an increase in the exchanges compliance budget and addition of staff, was in response to recent criticisms that the CMEs current surveillance was not able to keep up with increased demands of recent volatility and volume, the CME said. The new surveillance program calls for the addition of three floor investigators and five compliance investigators, the CME said. Some of the new staff will monitor the exchanges new Computerized Trade Reconstruction system, scheduled to start July 1. In addition, three computer programmers will be added to assist in regulatory support for the exchanges management information system department. Recent criticism has been especially directed at the CMEs Standard and Poors stock index futures and options division. A special membership referendum to prohibit CME members from filling customer orders and trading for their own account in S and P 500 futures and options will be voted on April 13. In a letter dated March 12, CME chairman John Sandner and Executive committee chairman Leo Melamed urged members to reject the referendum in favor a series of new rules. Included in the rule changes was the requirement that futures brokers in the S and P pit manually record all personal trades to the nearest minute, intended to enhance the effectiveness of surveillance and compliance functions, We made a promise to our members that we have kept, Melamed said in a release today. He said the new surveillance program represents a commitment to a vigorous enforcement policy.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Phillips_Chapel_CME_Church	http://dbpedia.org/resource/2013_CME_Group_Titleholders	http://dbpedia.org/resource/2014_CME_Group_Tour_Championship	http://dbpedia.org/resource/2015_CME_Group_Tour_Championship	http://dbpedia.org/resource/CME_SPAN	http://dbpedia.org/resource/2011_CME_Group_Titleholders	http://dbpedia.org/resource/2012_CME_Group_Titleholders	http://dbpedia.org/resource/2016_CME_Group_Tour_Championship	http://dbpedia.org/resource/CME_Group_Tour_Championship
The Boeing Company	22	40	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Boeing	Faulty repair work by The Boeing Company BA.N was a contributary cause to a Japan Air Lines Co Ltd JAPN.Y 747 crash on August 12, 1985, that killed 520 people, the final draft of a Ministry of Transport report says. There were only four survivors when the aircraft crashed into a mountain north of Tokyo. The report said inadequate inspection of the aircraft by Japanese inspectors after the repairs was another factor in the crash. The crew were cleared of any responsibility for the disaster. The report, which was sent on March 23 to the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board for comment, should be released in late May. Under an international convention the draft must be submitted for final comments to the relevant authorities. Boeing spokesmen were unavailable for comment. On April 4, a Boeing spokesman at the firms headquarters said the company would probably make no comment on the Japanese investigation teams report until it was officially released. On September 6, 1985, Boeing said in a statement that the 1978 repairs it had undertaken were faulty. This statement did not, however, connect the faulty repairs with the cause of the crash.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/List_of_Speakers_of_the_House_of_Representatives_of_Antigua_and_Barbuda	http://dbpedia.org/resource/The_Disrupt	http://dbpedia.org/resource/The_Sims_3:_World_Adventures	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Long_Live_the_Lady!	http://dbpedia.org/resource/The_Sarah_Balabagan_Story	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Academies_of_the_NSD_University_Teachers'_League	http://dbpedia.org/resource/The_Argus_(Seattle)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/The_Writing_69th	http://dbpedia.org/resource/The_Rich-Tone_Chorus	http://dbpedia.org/resource/1941_in_the_United_Kingdom

Poland	488	494	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Poland	Plans to rejuvenate Polands economy by reducing central government control would help reassure Western creditors that the countrys economy was safe to invest in, a senior Polish official said. The business of granting loans to Poland is not as bad a business as you might imagine, senior Polish government spokesman Jerzy Urban told a news conference in Stockholm. Urban, visiting the Swedish capital to deliver a lecture at the Foreign Policy Institute, announced earlier this week that Poland would soon offer shares to private citizens in state companies in a bid to make the economy more responsive. This was part of a major economic reform to be announced in the coming weeks, he said. Urban said the main problem with his countrys foreign debt burden of 32 billion dollars was short term interest charges but the long term looked more secure. He said he hoped talks under way with the Paris Club, grouping Polands main government creditors, would shortly solve the problem of short term servicing. Urban told reporters that debt servicing was hampering the expansion of the national economy, but that the new plans for economic reform would open new vistas for Polish exports. He criticised the blocking efforts of some Western governments, whom he declined to name, for putting political considerations ahead of economic co-operation. After the lifting of U.S. Sanctions against the Polish economy we considered all political obstacles had been removed, but that has not been the case, Urban said.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Szymanów,_Greater_Poland_Voivodeship	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Poland_at_the_2002_Winter_Olympics	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sitnica,_Lesser_Poland_Voivodeship	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Poland_at_the_2002_Winter_Paralympics	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Poland_women's_national_handball_team	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sokolec,_Greater_Poland_Voivodeship	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Poland_Grand_Prix_Gliding_2010	http://dbpedia.org/resource/List_of_World_War_II_aces_from_Poland	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Lubasz,_Lesser_Poland_Voivodeship	http://dbpedia.org/resource/National_Electoral_Commission_(Poland)
First Boston Corp	0	17	http://dbpedia.org/resource/First_Boston	First Boston Corp analyst William Randol recommended the purchase of Texaco Inc today, saying the discount that investors have made in the share price to reflect the ongoing litigation with Pennzoil has been overdone relative to how we expect the case to conclude. Texacos stock rose 1/8 to 34-1/8. On Monday, the stock tumbled four points after the Supreme Court overturned a lower court decision that cut Texacos bond in the 10.3 billion dlr legal dispute with Pennzoil Co PZL to one billion dlrs. Yesterday, a Texas court granted a temporary injunction on the bond issue pending a hearing next week. The current litigation arose from Texacos buyout of Getty Oil Co in 1984. Pennzoil sued, arguing its earlier agreement to buy Getty was binding. Two Texas state courts upheld Pennzoils position. Randol, noting that the stock has suffered a great deal in the two years since the litigation was filed, said we recognize the legal problems but think investors have overdone it. He said the stock is selling at 48 pct of its asset value, and we think it represents a good value at this level.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/First_Commonwealth_Bank	http://dbpedia.org/resource/I_Caucasian_Corps_(Ottoman_Empire)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/First_Facet	http://dbpedia.org/resource/4th_Mechanized_Corps_(Soviet_Union)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/First_International_Bank_of_Israel	http://dbpedia.org/resource/First_African_Baptist_Church_and_Parsonage_(Waycross,_Georgia)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Abel_equation_of_the_first_kind	http://dbpedia.org/resource/First_Congregational_Church_(Porterville,_California)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/First_class_constraint	http://dbpedia.org/resource/First_baseman
Dominion Textile	697	713	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dominion_Textile	Dominion Textile Inc considers a published report that it has bought a stake in Burlington Industries Inc and is considering making a joint bid for the company to be a rumor, a company spokesman said. As far as I am concerned and the company is concerned, they are rumors and were not commenting on rumors, spokesman Michel Dufour told Reuters in response to a query. All the information that has been given out publicly is that, yes, Dominion Textile is interested in making an acquisition that big...probably based on that people are starting all sorts of rumors, he said. Dufour said yes when asked whether the report was only a rumor, but said the company was not prepared to comment further. Dominion Textile president and chairman Thomas Bell was out of town and unavailable for comment. Dominion Textile last year made an unsuccesful 104-mln- U.S.-dlr bid for Avondale Mills and has maintained a 120-mln- U.S.-dlr line of credit to be used for an American acquisition. Dufour said the company has been negotiating with many U.S. textile companies but would not say whether Burlington Industries was one of them. Burlingtons stock rose sharply this morning on the report, which said Dominion Textile had joined with U.S. investor Asher Edelman to buy a stake in the company and to consider making a takeover offer. Dominion Textile, which reported operating profit of 11.1 mln Canadian dlrs last year on sales of 926.5 mln dlrs, has repeatedly said it will concentrate on expanding into the U.S. The company has said it plans to diversify into new product and market areas in addition to expanding its textile operations.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dominions_3:_The_Awakening	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bangladesh_University_of_Textiles	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bhutan_Textile_Museum	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Amalgamated_Footwear_and_Textile_Workers'_Union_of_Australia	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cedar_bark_textile	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Old_Dominion_Monarchs_and_Lady_Monarchs	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Central_Museum_of_Textiles,_Łódź	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Paphia_textile	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Toronto-Dominion_Bank	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Old_Dominion_Glass_Company

Cordoba	2272	2279	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Córdoba_Province,_Argentina	Argentine grain producers adjusted their yield estimates for the 1986/87 coarse grain crop downward in the week to yesterday after the heavy rains at the end of March and beginning of April, trade sources said. They said sunflower, maize and sorghum production estimates had been reduced despite some later warm, dry weather, which has allowed a return to harvesting in some areas. However, as showers fell intermittently after last weekend, producers feared another spell of prolonged and intense rain could cause more damage to crops already badly hit this season. Rains in the middle of last week reached an average of 27 millimetres in parts of Buenos Aires province, 83 mm in Cordoba, 41 in Santa Fe, 50 in Entre Rios and Misiones, 95 in Corrientes, eight in Chaco and 35 in Formosa. There was no rainfall in the same period in La Pampa. Producers feared continued damp conditions could produce rotting and lead to still lower yield estimates for all the crops, including soybean. However, as the lands began drying later in the week harvesting advanced considerably, reaching between 36 and 40 pct of the area sown in the case of sunflower. Deterioration of the sunflower crop evident in harvested material in Cordoba, La Pampa and Buenos Aires forced yield estimates per hectare to be adjusted down again. The seasons sunflowerseed production is now forecast at 2.1 mln to 2.3 mln tonnes, against 2.2 mln to 2.4 mln forecast last week and down 43.9 to 48.8 pct on the 1985/86 record of 4.1 mln. Area sown to sunflowers was two to 2.2 mln hectares, 29.9 to 36.3 pct below the record 3.14 mln hectares last season. Maize harvesting has also reached 36 to 40 pct of the area sown. It is near completion in Cordoba and Santa Fe and will begin in La Pampa and southern Buenos Aires later in April. Production estimates for maize were down from last week at 9.5 mln to 9.8 mln tonnes, against 9.6 mln to 9.9 mln estimated previously. This is 22.2 to 23.4 pct below the 12.4 mln to 12.6 mln tonnes estimated by private sources for the 1985/86 crop and 21.9 to 25.8 pct down on the official figure of 12.8 mln tonnes. Maize was sown on 3.58 mln to 3.78 mln hectares, two to seven pct down on last seasons 3.85 mln. Sorghum was harvested on 23 to 25 pct of the area sown in Cordoba, Santa Fe and Chaco. Harvest will start in La Pampa and Buenos Aires in mid-April. The total area sown was 1.23 mln to 1.30 mln hectares, 10.3 to 15.2 pct down on the 1.45 mln sown last season. The new forecast for the sorghum crop is 2.9 mln to 3.2 mln tonnes compared with three mln to 3.3 mln forecast last week, and is 23.8 to 29.3 pct down on last seasons 4.1 mln to 4.2 mln tonne crop. The soybean crop for this season was not adjusted, remaining at a record 7.5 mln to 7.7 mln tonnes, up 4.2 to 5.5 pct on the 7.2 mln to 7.3 mln estimated by private sources for 1985/86 and 5.6 to 8.5 pct higher than the official figure of 7.1 mln. The area sown to soybeans this season was a record 3.7 mln to 3.8 mln hectares, 10.8 to 13.8 pct up on the record 3.34 mln sown in 1985/86. The soybean crop is showing excessive moisture in some areas and producers fear they may discover more damage. Some experimental harvesting was carried out in Santa Fe on areas making up only about one pct of the total crop but details on this were not available. Preparation of the fields for the 1987/88 wheat crop, which will be sown between May and August or September, has so far not been as intense as in previous years.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cordoba_University	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cannon_for_Cordoba	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cordoba_Initiative	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ricardo_Cordoba	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Chrysler_Cordoba	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Josh_Cordoba	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Nicaraguan_one_hundred-cordoba_note	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Episcopal_Palace,_Cordoba	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cordoba_cinclodes	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Catholic_University_of_Cordoba
Chiles	501	507	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Lawton_Chiles	The U.S. Senate Budget Committee ended its stalemate over a budget plan and approved by a single vote a revised 1988 budget proposed by chairman Lawton Chiles to cut the deficit to 133.7 billion next year. The new plan broke last week to cut the deficit to 133.7 billion next year. The new plan broke last week's gridlock in which the committee failed to approve a similar Chiles plan on a tie vote. Today, the measure was sent to the Senate 13 to 11. Among a series of changes to get the extra vote, Chiles added about 400 mln dlrs for additional, unspecified, agricultural spending programs to be paid with partly with higher user fees.

Brazil	1531	1537	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Brazil	J.P. Morgan and Co Inc said its first-quarter earnings fell by 3.2 pct, largely reflecting its previously announced decision to place on non-accrual status its 1.3 billion dlrs of medium- and long-term loans to Brazil. That decision, spurred by Brazils suspension of interest payments on February 20, reduced the quarters net income by 20 mln dlrs to 226.4 mln dlrs, compared with 233.9 mln in the first three months of 1986. Morgan also reported a loss of 1.8 mln dlrs from securities underwriting and trading, in contrast to a gain of 45.4 mln dlrs in the year-earlier period. In the fourth quarter of 1986, Morgan posted other trading losses of 5.5 mln dlrs because of setbacks in the trading and underwriting of Euromarket securities. Conditions in some sectors of the Euromarket remained difficult last quarter, with floating rate notes suffering heavy price falls, but a spokeswoman was unable to say whether Morgans trading losses were restricted to the Euromarket. On the positive side, Morgan reduced its provision for loan losses to 35 mln dlrs from 70 mln a year earlier. Foreign exchange trading income rose to 82 mln dlrs from 72.6 mln and trust income increased to 95.9 mln dlrs from 75.9 mln. Morgan said other operating income, mainly fees and commissions, rose to 102.2 mln dlrs from 88.4 mln, but net investment securities gains dropped to 43.1 mln from 58.1 mln. Net interest earnings were 490.4 mln dlrs in the first quarter, down from 499.4 mln a year earlier, and net yield fell to 2.79 pct from 3.20 pct. If Brazil had not been placed on non-accrual, which means that interest can be recorded as income only when payments are actually received, net interest earnings would have been 525.9 mln dlrs and net yield 2.99 pct. If Brazil does not resume payments, 1987 net would be cut by 72 mln dlrs, Morgan added. After the provision for loan losses, Morgans allowance for credit losses at the end of March totaled 953 mln dlrs compared with 910 mln at end-1986 and 815 mln a year earlier. It reported net recoveries of six mln dlrs after charge-offs of eight mln, compared with net charge-offs of 49 mln dlrs after recoveries of three mln a year earlier. Excluding Brazil, non-accruing loans at quarters end were 583 mln dlrs, down from 633 mln at end-1986 and 684 mln a year earlier. Non-interest expenses rose to 371.1 mln dlrs from 303.5 mln dlrs, with more than half the increase related to personnel costs, Morgan said.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Brazil_at_the_World_Championships_in_Athletics	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Brazil_at_the_1984_Summer_Olympics	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Santa_Catarina_River_(Brazil)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cricket_in_Brazil	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Brazil_at_the_1924_Summer_Olympics	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Governorate_General_of_Brazil	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ministry_of_Fishing_and_Aquaculture_(Brazil)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Brazil–Taiwan_relations	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Brazil_at_the_1976_Summer_Paralympics	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Communist_Party_of_Brazil
Reuters	336	343	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Reuters	Dominion Textile Inc considers a published report that it has bought a stake in Burlington Industries Inc and is considering making a joint bid for the company to be a rumor, a company spokesman said. As far as I am concerned and the company is concerned, they are rumors and were not commenting on rumors, spokesman Michel Dufour told Reuters in response to a query. All the information that has been given out publicly is that, yes, Dominion Textile is interested in making an acquisition that big...probably based on that people are starting all sorts of rumors, he said. Dufour said yes when asked whether the report was only a rumor, but said the company was not prepared to comment further. Dominion Textile president and chairman Thomas Bell was out of town and unavailable for comment. Dominion Textile last year made an unsuccesful 104-mln- U.S.-dlr bid for Avondale Mills and has maintained a 120-mln- U.S.-dlr line of credit to be used for an American acquisition. Dufour said the company has been negotiating with many U.S. textile companies but would not say whether Burlington Industries was one of them. Burlingtons stock rose sharply this morning on the report, which said Dominion Textile had joined with U.S. investor Asher Edelman to buy a stake in the company and to consider making a takeover offer. Dominion Textile, which reported operating profit of 11.1 mln Canadian dlrs last year on sales of 926.5 mln dlrs, has repeatedly said it will concentrate on expanding into the U.S. The company has said it plans to diversify into new product and market areas in addition to expanding its textile operations.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Reuters_Digital_Vision_Program	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thomson_Reuters_Citation_Laureates	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thomson_Reuters_Business_Classification	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Reuters_Instrument_Code	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thomson_Reuters_league_tables	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thomson_Reuters_Messenger	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Reuters_3000_Xtra	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Reuters_TV	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Reuters_Market_Light	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thomson_Reuters_Foundation

Pennzoil	190	198	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pennzoil	First Boston Corp analyst William Randol recommended the purchase of Texaco Inc today, saying the discount that investors have made in the share price to reflect the ongoing litigation with Pennzoil has been overdone relative to how we expect the case to conclude. Texacos stock rose 1/8 to 34-1/8. On Monday, the stock tumbled four points after the Supreme Court overturned a lower court decision that cut Texacos bond in the 10.3 billion dlr legal dispute with Pennzoil Co PZL to one billion dlrs. Yesterday, a Texas court granted a temporary injunction on the bond issue pending a hearing next week. The current litigation arose from Texacos buyout of Getty Oil Co in 1984. Pennzoil sued, arguing its earlier agreement to buy Getty was binding. Two Texas state courts upheld Pennzoils position. Randol, noting that the stock has suffered a great deal in the two years since the litigation was filed, said we recognize the legal problems but think investors have overdone it. He said the stock is selling at 48 pct of its asset value, and we think it represents a good value at this level.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/2000_Pennzoil_400	http://dbpedia.org/resource/2013_Shell-Pennzoil_Grand_Prix_of_Houston	http://dbpedia.org/resource/1997_Pennzoil_200	http://dbpedia.org/resource/2001_Pennzoil_Freedom_400	http://dbpedia.org/resource/1999_Pennzoil_400	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pennzoil_Place
CME	300	303	http://dbpedia.org/resource/CME_Group	The Chicago Mercantile Exchange, CME, said it has added a new chief compliance officer and will expand its regulatory surveillance program. Paul OKelly, currently assistant regional administrator of the Securities and Exchange Commission, was named vice-president of compliance for the exchange, the CME said. The expanded compliance program, which calls for an increase in the exchanges compliance budget and addition of staff, was in response to recent criticisms that the CMEs current surveillance was not able to keep up with increased demands of recent volatility and volume, the CME said. The new surveillance program calls for the addition of three floor investigators and five compliance investigators, the CME said. Some of the new staff will monitor the exchanges new Computerized Trade Reconstruction system, scheduled to start July 1. In addition, three computer programmers will be added to assist in regulatory support for the exchanges management information system department. Recent criticism has been especially directed at the CMEs Standard and Poors stock index futures and options division. A special membership referendum to prohibit CME members from filling customer orders and trading for their own account in S and P 500 futures and options will be voted on April 13. In a letter dated March 12, CME chairman John Sandner and Executive committee chairman Leo Melamed urged members to reject the referendum in favor a series of new rules. Included in the rule changes was the requirement that futures brokers in the S and P pit manually record all personal trades to the nearest minute, intended to enhance the effectiveness of surveillance and compliance functions, We made a promise to our members that we have kept, Melamed said in a release today. He said the new surveillance program represents a commitment to a vigorous enforcement policy.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/2012_CME_Group_Titleholders	http://dbpedia.org/resource/2014_CME_Group_Tour_Championship	http://dbpedia.org/resource/2011_CME_Group_Titleholders	http://dbpedia.org/resource/2015_CME_Group_Tour_Championship	http://dbpedia.org/resource/2016_CME_Group_Tour_Championship	http://dbpedia.org/resource/CME_Group_Tour_Championship	http://dbpedia.org/resource/2013_CME_Group_Titleholders	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Phillips_Chapel_CME_Church	http://dbpedia.org/resource/CME_SPAN
Supreme Court	158	171	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States	Securities and Exchange Commission John Shad said he wanted Congress to write a better definition of insider trading but thought action should wait until the Supreme Court ruled on an insider trading case. Id like the benefit of the Winans decision before deciding on a definition, Shad told a Senate Appropriations subcommittee hearing. Shad was refering to the appeal by former Wall Street Journal reporter R. Foster Winans of his conviction on insider trading charges for telling a friend in advance what stocks he was going to write about in his column. The stocks usually went up or down in price depending on Winans recommendation. He said insider trading accounted for only 11 percent of the SECs enforcement activities last year despite the publicity given to recent major cases. Insider trading makes up only a tiny fraction of one pct of the 50 billion dlrs of daily securities trading, Shad said. Shad asked for a budget increase so the SEC could enlarge its enforcement staff by 20 this year and 73 next year to deal with all types of securities fraud. Shad said he hoped to start his new duties as U.S. Ambassador to the Netherlands by June. He said he did not know when his successor would be named by President Reagan.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Battle_of_Fairfax_Court_House_(June_1861)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/List_of_United_States_Supreme_Court_cases,_volume_78	http://dbpedia.org/resource/City_of_Westminster_Magistrates'_Court	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Town_of_Halifax_Court_House_Historic_District	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Court_at_744-756½_S._Marengo_Ave.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/List_of_United_States_Supreme_Court_cases,_volume_65	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Aboriginal_Community_Court	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Court_leet	http://dbpedia.org/resource/2014_Boyd_Tinsley_Women's_Clay_Court_Classic	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Oral_reasons_of_the_Supreme_Court_of_Canada

Reagan	145	151	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ronald_Reagan	A Treasury official said there are no plans to try to reduce the U.S. budget deficit by issuing yen-denominated bonds that would become known as Reagan bonds. It simply isnt something that we are planning to do, the official said. He added the Treasury was aware of Japanese news reports suggesting the Reagan administration might issue such bonds as the former Carter administration did when it sold Carter bonds denominated in West German marks. But he said the situation was greatly different now. If you look at the differences between the treasury market now and in the Carter administration years, it is a much more global market now, the official said. There was not the same ease then for the holder of another currency to buy other countries securities, he added, But there is no difficulty now for them to purchase dollars and buy U.S. securities. The United States needs dollars, not Japanese yen, to pay its debts and reduce the deficit and so has no plans to issue yen-denominated bonds, he emphasized.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ronald_Reagan_Parkway	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Lisa_Reagan	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Birthplace_of_Ronald_Reagan	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Electoral_history_of_Ronald_Reagan	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Rip_Reagan	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Foreign_policy_of_the_Ronald_Reagan_administration	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Reagan_Gomez-Preston	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mike_Reagan	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Volume_1_(Reagan_Youth_album)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ronald_Reagan_Cross_County_Highway

A spokesman said VWs supervisory board will meet tomorrow to discuss the payout. A statement will be made afterwards. VW has also said disclosed profits for 1986 will reach their 1985 level, despite provisions of a possible 480 mln marks linked to the currency affair. The figure is virtually the same as the 477 mln mark 1985 parent company net profit. When VW first confirmed the currency scandal on March 10 it said the management board would propose an unchanged 10-mark dividend to the supervisory board. A dividend of 11 marks would be proposed for the companys new preference shares. Share analysts said they saw supervisory board approval of the management board proposal as virtually a formality. Anything else would be more than a surprise, one said. Company sources said VW would have to dig into reserves to maintain the disclosed profit.

Cordoba	1216	1223	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Córdoba_Province,_Argentina	Argentine grain producers adjusted their yield estimates for the 1986/87 coarse grain crop downward in the week to yesterday after the heavy rains at the end of March and beginning of April, trade sources said. They said sunflower, maize and sorghum production estimates had been reduced despite some later warm, dry weather, which has allowed a return to harvesting in some areas. However, as showers fell intermittently after last weekend, producers feared another spell of prolonged and intense rain could cause more damage to crops already badly hit this season. Rains in the middle of last week reached an average of 27 millimetres in parts of Buenos Aires province, 83 mm in Cordoba, 41 in Santa Fe, 50 in Entre Rios and Misiones, 95 in Corrientes, eight in Chaco and 35 in Formosa. There was no rainfall in the same period in La Pampa. Producers feared continued damp conditions could produce rotting and lead to still lower yield estimates for all the crops, including soybean. However, as the lands began drying later in the week harvesting advanced considerably, reaching between 36 and 40 pct of the area sown in the case of sunflower. Deterioration of the sunflower crop evident in harvested material in Cordoba, La Pampa and Buenos Aires forced yield estimates per hectare to be adjusted down again. The seasons sunflowerseed production is now forecast at 2.1 mln to 2.3 mln tonnes, against 2.2 mln to 2.4 mln forecast last week and down 43.9 to 48.8 pct on the 1985/86 record of 4.1 mln. Area sown to sunflowers was two to 2.2 mln hectares, 29.9 to 36.3 pct below the record 3.14 mln hectares last season. Maize harvesting has also reached 36 to 40 pct of the area sown. It is near completion in Cordoba and Santa Fe and will begin in La Pampa and southern Buenos Aires later in April. Production estimates for maize were down from last week at 9.5 mln to 9.8 mln tonnes, against 9.6 mln to 9.9 mln estimated previously. This is 22.2 to 23.4 pct below the 12.4 mln to 12.6 mln tonnes estimated by private sources for the 1985/86 crop and 21.9 to 25.8 pct down on the official figure of 12.8 mln tonnes. Maize was sown on 3.58 mln to 3.78 mln hectares, two to seven pct down on last seasons 3.85 mln. Sorghum was harvested on 23 to 25 pct of the area sown in Cordoba, Santa Fe and Chaco. Harvest will start in La Pampa and Buenos Aires in mid-April. The total area sown was 1.23 mln to 1.30 mln hectares, 10.3 to 15.2 pct down on the 1.45 mln sown last season. The new forecast for the sorghum crop is 2.9 mln to 3.2 mln tonnes compared with three mln to 3.3 mln forecast last week, and is 23.8 to 29.3 pct down on last seasons 4.1 mln to 4.2 mln tonne crop. The soybean crop for this season was not adjusted, remaining at a record 7.5 mln to 7.7 mln tonnes, up 4.2 to 5.5 pct on the 7.2 mln to 7.3 mln estimated by private sources for 1985/86 and 5.6 to 8.5 pct higher than the official figure of 7.1 mln. The area sown to soybeans this season was a record 3.7 mln to 3.8 mln hectares, 10.8 to 13.8 pct up on the record 3.34 mln sown in 1985/86. The soybean crop is showing excessive moisture in some areas and producers fear they may discover more damage. Some experimental harvesting was carried out in Santa Fe on areas making up only about one pct of the total crop but details on this were not available. Preparation of the fields for the 1987/88 wheat crop, which will be sown between May and August or September, has so far not been as intense as in previous years.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Catholic_University_of_Cordoba	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cordoba_Treasure	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Joaquín_Lloréns_Fernández_de_Cordoba	http://dbpedia.org/resource/MSC_Cordoba	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cordoba_Fighting_Dog	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pedro_de_Cordoba	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Nicaraguan_twenty-cordoba_note	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cannon_for_Cordoba	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Alliance_Union_of_Cordoba	http://dbpedia.org/resource/SS_Sierra_Cordoba_(1913)
Edouard Balladur	301	317	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Édouard_Balladur	Top officials of leading industrial nations arrived at the U.S. Treasury main building to begin a meeting of the Group of Five. Officials seen arriving by Reuter correspondents included West German Finance Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg and Bundesbank President Karl Otto Poehl, French Finance Minister Edouard Balladur and his central banker Jacques de Larosiere. Also seen arriving were Japanese Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa and Japans central bank governor Satoshi Sumita and British Chancellor of the Exchequer and central bank governor Robin Leigh Pemberton. There was no immediate sign of Italian or Canadian officials. Monetary sources have said a fully blown meeting of the Group of Seven is expected to begin around 3 p.m. local time (1900 gmt) and last at least until 6 p.m. (2200 gmt), when a communique is expected to be issued. Italian sources said Italian acting Finance Minister Giovanni Goria met Treasury Secretary James Baker last night. At those talks Baker apparently convinced Goria, who declined to attend the February meeting of the Group of Seven in Paris, that Italy would participate fully in any meaningful decisions.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Edouard_Bihouee	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Calvin_Edouard_Ward	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Musée_Edouard_Branly	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Edouard_Getaz	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Edouard_Wah	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Edouard-Ernest_Maire	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Edouard_Oum_Ndeki	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Edouard_Silas	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Edouard_Brunner	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Edouard_F._Henriques
Dominion	1139	1147	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dominion_Textile	The largest U.S. textile maker focused on its own business as its competitors found merger partners, but now Burlington Industries Inc may have restructured itself into an attractive takeover candidate, analysts said. The takeover spotlight fell today on Burlington, which rose 4-7/8 to 52-7/8 on speculation that investor Asher Edelman and Dominion Textiles Inc of Canada bought an almost five pct stake. A published report said Edelman and Dominion jointly acquired a stake in Burlington and were weighing a takeover offer. Edelman would not comment, and a spokesman for Montreal-based Dominion called the report just rumors. Burlington said it did not know if the report was true. Wall Street professionals said they were not convinced of the story or that Edelman and Dominion would be the victors if Burlington actually came into play. Arbitragers said past comments from Dominion, however, added credence to the speculation. Dominion has said that it was looking for a takeover in the U.S. Last year, Dominion unsuccessfully bid for Avondale Mills and has maintained a 120 mln dlr line of credit to be used for a U.S. acquisition. A Dominion spokesman said Canadas largest textile producer has been negotiating with many U.S. textile companies, but would not say whether Burlington was among them. There have been acquisitions in this area. Its not unusual that someone could be looking at Burlington after the housecleaning theyve done, said Eileen Gormley of Thomson McKinnon. Burlington sold its domestic operations, which made sheets and other linens, to J.P. Stevens and Co Inc for 110 mln dlrs last year. It also has reorganized management, and focused its operations on businesses that would be less affected by foreign competition, Gormley said. Theyve pulled back so as not to be a commodity marketer, said Gormley. She said in moving more heavily into industrial fabrics, Burlington bought C.H. Masland, which supplies carpets and other fabric to the auto industry. In the past, they just spent and never realized the return on the outlays they did make, she said. You look at their record over the year, and I think theyre poised to be more profitable than they had been in the past, Gormley said. She estimated 1987 earnings of 2.50 dlrs per share, up from 2.01 dlrs per share. Some analysts today recommended clients not buy Burlington at its current levels. Edward Johnson of Johnson Redbook said he recommends selling. He said he believes the stock is worth only about 50 dlrs on a takeover basis and about 46 dlrs on an earnings basis. Some arbitragers, however, said takeover values have been placed on the company of 60 to 65 dlrs per share. After Ashers (Edelman) recent history, a lot of people dont find him very credible anymore, said one arbitrager. Another, however, said Edelman succeeds in forcing managements to take steps to enhance shareholder values even if he doesnt win the target company. Edelman was unsuccessful last year in offers for Lucky Stores Inc and Fruehauf Corp. He did succeed in buying Ponderosa Inc. The stocks of other textile makers rose along with Burlington. J.P. Stevens STN climbed 5/8 to 44-7/8, and Fieldcrest Cannon Inc FLD, the result of a merger of Fieldcrest and Cannon, rose 1-1/8 to 39-3/4. West Point-Pepperell Inc WPM rose 1-7/8 to 67-1/8.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dominion_Chair_Company	http://dbpedia.org/resource/1963_Old_Dominion_500	http://dbpedia.org/resource/New_Dominion,_Nova_Scotia	http://dbpedia.org/resource/2016_Old_Dominion_Monarchs_football_team	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dominion_Hill	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Evocation_I:_The_Arcane_Dominion	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dominion_Academy_of_Dayton	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dominion_7.5_in_Osaka-jo_Hall	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dominion_Road_School	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dominion_6.18

Melamed	1743	1750	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Leo_Melamed	The Chicago Mercantile Exchange, CME, said it has added a new chief compliance officer and will expand its regulatory surveillance program. Paul OKelly, currently assistant regional administrator of the Securities and Exchange Commission, was named vice-president of compliance for the exchange, the CME said. The expanded compliance program, which calls for an increase in the exchanges compliance budget and addition of staff, was in response to recent criticisms that the CMEs current surveillance was not able to keep up with increased demands of recent volatility and volume, the CME said. The new surveillance program calls for the addition of three floor investigators and five compliance investigators, the CME said. Some of the new staff will monitor the exchanges new Computerized Trade Reconstruction system, scheduled to start July 1. In addition, three computer programmers will be added to assist in regulatory support for the exchanges management information system department. Recent criticism has been especially directed at the CMEs Standard and Poors stock index futures and options division. A special membership referendum to prohibit CME members from filling customer orders and trading for their own account in S and P 500 futures and options will be voted on April 13. In a letter dated March 12, CME chairman John Sandner and Executive committee chairman Leo Melamed urged members to reject the referendum in favor a series of new rules. Included in the rule changes was the requirement that futures brokers in the S and P pit manually record all personal trades to the nearest minute, intended to enhance the effectiveness of surveillance and compliance functions, We made a promise to our members that we have kept, Melamed said in a release today. He said the new surveillance program represents a commitment to a vigorous enforcement policy.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Avraham_Melamed	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Melamed	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ezra_Zion_Melamed	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Maickel_Melamed	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Zalman_Baruch_Melamed	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Stephen_Melamed	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Eliezer_Melamed	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Fred_Melamed	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Vince_Melamed	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ken_Melamed
Reagan	1815	1821	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ronald_Reagan	Senior Japanese officials tomorrow open talks with American trade negotiators in a last-ditch effort to avert new high U.S. tariffs to be imposed on a wide variety of Japanese electronic exports. Makoto Kuroda, vice minister of Japans Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI), is to hold two days of meetings with the Deputy U.S. Trade Representative, Michael Smith, and the Under Secretary of Commerce, Bruce Smart. The new tariffs, to go into effect on April 17, are in retaliation for Japans failure to adhere to an agreement to end dumping semiconductors in world markets at below cost and to open its home market to U.S. semiconductor shipments. They are to be imposed on goods which use semiconductors, including television and audio equipment and computers. Both U.S. and Japanese officials have said there was little likelihood the talks would do anything to avert the 100 pct duties on 300 mln dlrs worth of Japanese shipments. President Reagan announced the planned tariffs on March 27 after he said that close monitoring of the July 1986 U.S.-Japanese semiconductor pact convinced U.S. officials that Japan was not honoring the agreement. In making the annoucement, Reagan said I am committed to the full enforcement of our trade agreements designed to provide American industry with free and fair trade. Trade analysts said his move was aimed as much at Japans semiconductor trade practices, which are said to have injured the U.S. semiconductor industry, as Congress, which has complained about presidential timidity on trade issues. Congressional Democrats have pledged to enact aggressive trade laws to counter what they contend has been Reagans inaction to redress the growing U.S. trade deficit, which last year reached 169.8 billion dlrs. About one-third of the deficit was with Japan. Reagan said there were recent signs Japan was beginning to adhere to the pact and that was why he was not terminating it. Kuroda said on leaving Tokyo today he had no new proposals but did have an explanation of the semiconductor situation. He told the daily newspaper Ashai Shimbun that Reagans decision was based on inaccurate data and an exaggerated sense of MITIs power to control Japanese traders. The United States has excessive expectations., he said. To stabilize supply-demand relations which have been disrupted by excess inventories since 1985 will take some time. He also said that U.S. firms had not been aggressive enough in trying to sell in the Japanese market.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Frank_Reagan_(Blue_Bloods)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Reagan_Pasternak	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Reagan_Field	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Foreign_policy_of_the_Ronald_Reagan_administration	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Reagan_County,_Texas	http://dbpedia.org/resource/List_of_federal_judges_appointed_by_Ronald_Reagan	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ron_Reagan	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Reagan_(EP)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Second_inauguration_of_Ronald_Reagan	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Electoral_history_of_Ronald_Reagan
Iran	619	623	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Iran	Iran decided to continue its operations east of Basra to destroy Iraqs forces, Iranian Prime Minister Mir-Hossein Mousavi told Tehran Radio. That seems to be the best spot for the complete destruction of (Iraqi President) Saddams forces. This is why it was decided that the operations would forcefully continue there, he said. At the same time, we have maintained our ability to act throughout the length of the fronts, Mousavi told the radio, monitored by the British Broadcasting Corporation. Tehran Radio reported over 1,500 Iraqi casualties today as Iran continued its Karbala-8 operation launched early yesterday. Iran said over 2,600 Iraqis had been killed or wounded yesterday. Iraq said today its forces had beaten back the latest attacks inflicting heavy casualties. Mousavi told Tehran radio that on the whole, our advances have broken the back of the military forces of Saddam. Earlier today the Iranian news agency IRNA said Tehrans forces were stabilising new positions after their assault on Iraqi lines defending Basra, Iraqs second city. In Baghdad, a military spokesman said Iraqi warplanes today destroyed an oil pumping station and a production unit at Irans Ahvaz field.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Road_14_(Iran)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Key,_Iran	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Maruf_(Iran)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tares,_Iran	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mirik,_Iran	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Geology_of_Iran	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Baraki,_Iran	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Constitution_of_the_Islamic_Republic_of_Iran	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Piman,_Iran	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Anglo-Soviet_invasion_of_Iran

DTI	648	651	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Department_of_Trade_and_Industry_(United_Kingdom)	Britain intends to negotiate further agreements on international securities regulation to match those now in force with the U.S. And Japan, government sources said. The Department of Trade and Industry said earlier it had concluded a memorandum of understanding with Japans Finance Ministry to swap supervisory and investigatory information. The agreement covers stocks, shares and government bonds, but not commodity futures, whose regulation in Japan does not come under the Finance Ministry. It therefore does not cover some transactions on the London International Financial Futures Exchange and the London commodities and metal exchanges. The DTI said it hoped to seek further understandings with other countries which met in the U.K. Last December. The meeting involved delegates from the U.K., Switzerland, the U.S., Canada, Australia, Hong Kong, Japan, France, West Germany and Holland. Government sources said the deal with Japan completes arrangements linking Tokyo, the U.S. And London. A U.K. Agreement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) was signed last September. Todays agreement will deal with requests for information on a case by case basis, U.K. Government sources said. It is not legally binding and comes into force immediately.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thomson_DTI_6300-16	http://dbpedia.org/resource/DTI_Data

Cordoba	1710	1717	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Córdoba_Province,_Argentina	Argentine grain producers adjusted their yield estimates for the 1986/87 coarse grain crop downward in the week to yesterday after the heavy rains at the end of March and beginning of April, trade sources said. They said sunflower, maize and sorghum production estimates had been reduced despite some later warm, dry weather, which has allowed a return to harvesting in some areas. However, as showers fell intermittently after last weekend, producers feared another spell of prolonged and intense rain could cause more damage to crops already badly hit this season. Rains in the middle of last week reached an average of 27 millimetres in parts of Buenos Aires province, 83 mm in Cordoba, 41 in Santa Fe, 50 in Entre Rios and Misiones, 95 in Corrientes, eight in Chaco and 35 in Formosa. There was no rainfall in the same period in La Pampa. Producers feared continued damp conditions could produce rotting and lead to still lower yield estimates for all the crops, including soybean. However, as the lands began drying later in the week harvesting advanced considerably, reaching between 36 and 40 pct of the area sown in the case of sunflower. Deterioration of the sunflower crop evident in harvested material in Cordoba, La Pampa and Buenos Aires forced yield estimates per hectare to be adjusted down again. The seasons sunflowerseed production is now forecast at 2.1 mln to 2.3 mln tonnes, against 2.2 mln to 2.4 mln forecast last week and down 43.9 to 48.8 pct on the 1985/86 record of 4.1 mln. Area sown to sunflowers was two to 2.2 mln hectares, 29.9 to 36.3 pct below the record 3.14 mln hectares last season. Maize harvesting has also reached 36 to 40 pct of the area sown. It is near completion in Cordoba and Santa Fe and will begin in La Pampa and southern Buenos Aires later in April. Production estimates for maize were down from last week at 9.5 mln to 9.8 mln tonnes, against 9.6 mln to 9.9 mln estimated previously. This is 22.2 to 23.4 pct below the 12.4 mln to 12.6 mln tonnes estimated by private sources for the 1985/86 crop and 21.9 to 25.8 pct down on the official figure of 12.8 mln tonnes. Maize was sown on 3.58 mln to 3.78 mln hectares, two to seven pct down on last seasons 3.85 mln. Sorghum was harvested on 23 to 25 pct of the area sown in Cordoba, Santa Fe and Chaco. Harvest will start in La Pampa and Buenos Aires in mid-April. The total area sown was 1.23 mln to 1.30 mln hectares, 10.3 to 15.2 pct down on the 1.45 mln sown last season. The new forecast for the sorghum crop is 2.9 mln to 3.2 mln tonnes compared with three mln to 3.3 mln forecast last week, and is 23.8 to 29.3 pct down on last seasons 4.1 mln to 4.2 mln tonne crop. The soybean crop for this season was not adjusted, remaining at a record 7.5 mln to 7.7 mln tonnes, up 4.2 to 5.5 pct on the 7.2 mln to 7.3 mln estimated by private sources for 1985/86 and 5.6 to 8.5 pct higher than the official figure of 7.1 mln. The area sown to soybeans this season was a record 3.7 mln to 3.8 mln hectares, 10.8 to 13.8 pct up on the record 3.34 mln sown in 1985/86. The soybean crop is showing excessive moisture in some areas and producers fear they may discover more damage. Some experimental harvesting was carried out in Santa Fe on areas making up only about one pct of the total crop but details on this were not available. Preparation of the fields for the 1987/88 wheat crop, which will be sown between May and August or September, has so far not been as intense as in previous years.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/America/Argentina/Cordoba	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cordoba_Fighting_Dog	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cordoba_Agreement,_2006	http://dbpedia.org/resource/2012_Copa_Agco_Cordoba	http://dbpedia.org/resource/2012_Copa_Agco_Cordoba_–_Singles	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Nicaraguan_five_hundred-cordoba_note	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Nicaraguan_ten-cordoba_note	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Copa_Agco_Cordoba	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cordoba_University	http://dbpedia.org/resource/MSC_Cordoba

Officials seen arriving by Reuter correspondents included West German Finance Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg and Bundesbank President Karl Otto Poehl, French Finance Minister Edouard Balladur and his central banker Jacques de Larosiere. Also seen arriving were Japanese Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa and Japans central bank governor Satoshi Sumita and British Chancellor of the Exchequer and central bank governor Robin Leigh Pemberton. There was no immediate sign of Italian or Canadian officials. Monetary sources have said a fully blown meeting of the Group of Seven is expected to begin around 3 p.m. local time (1900 gmt) and last at least until 6 p.m. (2200 gmt), when a communique is expected to be issued. Italian sources said Italian acting Finance Minister Giovanni Goria met Treasury Secretary James Baker last night.

Baghdad	1057	1064	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Baghdad	Iran decided to continue its operations east of Basra to destroy Iraqs forces, Iranian Prime Minister Mir-Hossein Mousavi told Tehran Radio. That seems to be the best spot for the complete destruction of (Iraqi President) Saddams forces. This is why it was decided that the operations would forcefully continue there, he said. At the same time, we have maintained our ability to act throughout the length of the fronts, Mousavi told the radio, monitored by the British Broadcasting Corporation. Tehran Radio reported over 1,500 Iraqi casualties today as Iran continued its Karbala-8 operation launched early yesterday. Iran said over 2,600 Iraqis had been killed or wounded yesterday. Iraq said today its forces had beaten back the latest attacks inflicting heavy casualties. Mousavi told Tehran radio that on the whole, our advances have broken the back of the military forces of Saddam. Earlier today the Iranian news agency IRNA said Tehrans forces were stabilising new positions after their assault on Iraqi lines defending Basra, Iraqs second city. In Baghdad, a military spokesman said Iraqi warplanes today destroyed an oil pumping station and a production unit at Irans Ahvaz field.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Fall_of_Baghdad_(1917)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Capture_of_Baghdad_(1624)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Baghdad_Governorate	http://dbpedia.org/resource/January_2014_Baghdad_bombings	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Baghdad_Street_(Damascus)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/17_August_2010_Baghdad_bombings	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dora,_Baghdad	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Armenian_Catholic_Archeparchy_of_Baghdad	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Baghdad_Medical_City	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Baghdad_International_Airport

Noranda Inc	99	110	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Noranda_(mining_company)	Quebec mines minister Raymond Savoie said the province is prepared to offer money to help re-open (Noranda Inc))'s Murdochville, Quebec copper mine, shut down by fire last week, but said he could not give a specific figure until damage estimates have been completed. Federal member of parliament for the region,  Charles-Eugene Marin, said last week the federal government is also prepared to provide financial help to restart operations as soon as possible. Noranda has estimated damage from the fire at about 10 mln dlrs and a company spokesman said it should have a more specific estimate by the end of the month. Noranda said it had hoped to have an estimate sooner, but has found that it will take longer than expected to gain access to the burned-out area. Noranda said the mine was not insured.  said the mine was not insured.

Plant Vogtle nuclear power station	134	168	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Vogtle_Electric_Generating_Plant	An audit submitted to the Georgia Public Service Commission claims that between 944 mln dlrs and 1.8 billion dlrs of the costs of the Plant Vogtle nuclear power station should be disallowed, a Southern Co spokeswoman said. Southerns Georgia Power Co subsidiary has a 45.7 pct interest in the plant and estimated earlier this year it would cost a total of 8.87 billion dlrs. Last year, the plants owners pledged to Georgia regulators they would limit the cost passed on to rate payers to 8.4 billion dlrs. The Southern spokeswoman said the company feels the report by OBrien-Kreitzberg is flawed and biased. She said the report was released yesterday by the state attorney general. Responding to the report today, Georgia Power Chairman Robert W. Scherer told a news conference the conclusions drawn by the firm are not only wrong -- they also reflect the same bias against nuclear power that these auditors have demonstrated in similar cases accross the country. Saying he was not suggesting Georgia power was without fault, Scherer said the audit identified several things I wish we had done differently. Scherer pointed out a report OBrien-Kreitzberg submitted to Georgia regulators in March 1986 projected Georgia Power would not finish Plant Vogtle unit one before the end of 1987. Noting unit one is finished, and we expect it to be in commercial operationg by June, he said the firms latest report ignored the earlier projection, gave the utility no credit for the completion and actually penalized us by suggesting that costs to maintain t he schedule be disallowed. Scherer said the latest audit alleges Georgia Power could have saved 95 mln dlrs if it had stopped using four shifts, seven days a week to speed construction three years sooner. He said this would have delayed completion of the plant for another year and it would have cost several hunderd million dlrs more. Noting the audit said costs were increased 600 mln dlrs by schedule delays totaling 20.5 months, he said First, we have the best concrete placement record in the industry, Second new government regulations after the Three Mile Island incident significantly increased construction time.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Visakhapatnam_railway_station	http://dbpedia.org/resource/New_Bolingbroke_railway_station	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Express_Bus_Terminal_Station	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Magic_Power_(Hey!_Say!_JUMP_song)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bishan_Railway_Station	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Esholt_railway_station	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Gōshi_Station	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Arbroath_railway_station	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hackney_Downs_railway_station	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Icelandic_hydroelectric_power_stations
London	990	996	http://dbpedia.org/resource/London	Britain intends to negotiate further agreements on international securities regulation to match those now in force with the U.S. And Japan, government sources said. The Department of Trade and Industry said earlier it had concluded a memorandum of understanding with Japans Finance Ministry to swap supervisory and investigatory information. The agreement covers stocks, shares and government bonds, but not commodity futures, whose regulation in Japan does not come under the Finance Ministry. It therefore does not cover some transactions on the London International Financial Futures Exchange and the London commodities and metal exchanges. The DTI said it hoped to seek further understandings with other countries which met in the U.K. Last December. The meeting involved delegates from the U.K., Switzerland, the U.S., Canada, Australia, Hong Kong, Japan, France, West Germany and Holland. Government sources said the deal with Japan completes arrangements linking Tokyo, the U.S. And London. A U.K. Agreement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) was signed last September. Todays agreement will deal with requests for information on a case by case basis, U.K. Government sources said.

Burlington Industries Inc	109	134	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Burlington_Industries	The largest U.S. textile maker focused on its own business as its competitors found merger partners, but now Burlington Industries Inc may have restructured itself into an attractive takeover candidate, analysts said. The takeover spotlight fell today on Burlington, which rose 4-7/8 to 52-7/8 on speculation that investor Asher Edelman and Dominion Textiles Inc of Canada bought an almost five pct stake. A published report said Edelman and Dominion jointly acquired a stake in Burlington and were weighing a takeover offer. Edelman would not comment, and a spokesman for Montreal-based Dominion called the report just rumors. Burlington said it did not know if the report was true. Wall Street professionals said they were not convinced of the story or that Edelman and Dominion would be the victors if Burlington actually came into play. Arbitragers said past comments from Dominion, however, added credence to the speculation. Dominion has said that it was looking for a takeover in the U.S. Last year, Dominion unsuccessfully bid for Avondale Mills and has maintained a 120 mln dlr line of credit to be used for a U.S. acquisition. A Dominion spokesman said Canadas largest textile producer has been negotiating with many U.S. textile companies, but would not say whether Burlington was among them. There have been acquisitions in this area. Its not unusual that someone could be looking at Burlington after the housecleaning theyve done, said Eileen Gormley of Thomson McKinnon. Burlington sold its domestic operations, which made sheets and other linens, to J.P. Stevens and Co Inc for 110 mln dlrs last year. It also has reorganized management, and focused its operations on businesses that would be less affected by foreign competition, Gormley said. Theyve pulled back so as not to be a commodity marketer, said Gormley. She said in moving more heavily into industrial fabrics, Burlington bought C.H. Masland, which supplies carpets and other fabric to the auto industry. In the past, they just spent and never realized the return on the outlays they did make, she said. You look at their record over the year, and I think theyre poised to be more profitable than they had been in the past, Gormley said. She estimated 1987 earnings of 2.50 dlrs per share, up from 2.01 dlrs per share. Some analysts today recommended clients not buy Burlington at its current levels. Edward Johnson of Johnson Redbook said he recommends selling. He said he believes the stock is worth only about 50 dlrs on a takeover basis and about 46 dlrs on an earnings basis. Some arbitragers, however, said takeover values have been placed on the company of 60 to 65 dlrs per share. After Ashers (Edelman) recent history, a lot of people dont find him very credible anymore, said one arbitrager. Another, however, said Edelman succeeds in forcing managements to take steps to enhance shareholder values even if he doesnt win the target company. Edelman was unsuccessful last year in offers for Lucky Stores Inc and Fruehauf Corp. He did succeed in buying Ponderosa Inc. The stocks of other textile makers rose along with Burlington. J.P. Stevens STN climbed 5/8 to 44-7/8, and Fieldcrest Cannon Inc FLD, the result of a merger of Fieldcrest and Cannon, rose 1-1/8 to 39-3/4. West Point-Pepperell Inc WPM rose 1-7/8 to 67-1/8.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Association_of_Radio_Industries_and_Businesses	http://dbpedia.org/resource/V-Guard_Industries	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Railway_Express_Agency,_Inc._v._New_York	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Electric_power_industry	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mojo_Motors,_Inc.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Oil_shale_industry	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Toyota_Commemorative_Museum_of_Industry_and_Technology	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Zip_Industries	http://dbpedia.org/resource/T._B._Harms_&_Francis,_Day_&_Hunter,_Inc.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/EPlus_Inc

Dominion Textile	1189	1205	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dominion_Textile	Dominion Textile Inc considers a published report that it has bought a stake in Burlington Industries Inc and is considering making a joint bid for the company to be a rumor, a company spokesman said. As far as I am concerned and the company is concerned, they are rumors and were not commenting on rumors, spokesman Michel Dufour told Reuters in response to a query. All the information that has been given out publicly is that, yes, Dominion Textile is interested in making an acquisition that big...probably based on that people are starting all sorts of rumors, he said. Dufour said yes when asked whether the report was only a rumor, but said the company was not prepared to comment further. Dominion Textile president and chairman Thomas Bell was out of town and unavailable for comment. Dominion Textile last year made an unsuccesful 104-mln- U.S.-dlr bid for Avondale Mills and has maintained a 120-mln- U.S.-dlr line of credit to be used for an American acquisition. Dufour said the company has been negotiating with many U.S. textile companies but would not say whether Burlington Industries was one of them. Burlingtons stock rose sharply this morning on the report, which said Dominion Textile had joined with U.S. investor Asher Edelman to buy a stake in the company and to consider making a takeover offer. Dominion Textile, which reported operating profit of 11.1 mln Canadian dlrs last year on sales of 926.5 mln dlrs, has repeatedly said it will concentrate on expanding into the U.S. The company has said it plans to diversify into new product and market areas in addition to expanding its textile operations.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mary_White_(textile_designer)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dominion_Cove_Point_LNG	http://dbpedia.org/resource/National_Textile_Museum	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Northern_Ireland_Textile_Workers'_Union	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Spindle_(textiles)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Under-Secretary_of_State_for_Dominion_Affairs	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dominion-Provincial_Student_Loan_Program	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Masood_Textile_Mills	http://dbpedia.org/resource/2009_Old_Dominion_Monarchs_football_team	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Lust's_Dominion
Ashai Shimbun	2084	2097	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Asahi_Shimbun	Senior Japanese officials tomorrow open talks with American trade negotiators in a last-ditch effort to avert new high U.S. tariffs to be imposed on a wide variety of Japanese electronic exports. Makoto Kuroda, vice minister of Japans Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI), is to hold two days of meetings with the Deputy U.S. Trade Representative, Michael Smith, and the Under Secretary of Commerce, Bruce Smart. The new tariffs, to go into effect on April 17, are in retaliation for Japans failure to adhere to an agreement to end dumping semiconductors in world markets at below cost and to open its home market to U.S. semiconductor shipments. They are to be imposed on goods which use semiconductors, including television and audio equipment and computers. Both U.S. and Japanese officials have said there was little likelihood the talks would do anything to avert the 100 pct duties on 300 mln dlrs worth of Japanese shipments. President Reagan announced the planned tariffs on March 27 after he said that close monitoring of the July 1986 U.S.-Japanese semiconductor pact convinced U.S. officials that Japan was not honoring the agreement. In making the annoucement, Reagan said I am committed to the full enforcement of our trade agreements designed to provide American industry with free and fair trade. Trade analysts said his move was aimed as much at Japans semiconductor trade practices, which are said to have injured the U.S. semiconductor industry, as Congress, which has complained about presidential timidity on trade issues. Congressional Democrats have pledged to enact aggressive trade laws to counter what they contend has been Reagans inaction to redress the growing U.S. trade deficit, which last year reached 169.8 billion dlrs. About one-third of the deficit was with Japan. Reagan said there were recent signs Japan was beginning to adhere to the pact and that was why he was not terminating it. Kuroda said on leaving Tokyo today he had no new proposals but did have an explanation of the semiconductor situation. He told the daily newspaper Ashai Shimbun that Reagans decision was based on inaccurate data and an exaggerated sense of MITIs power to control Japanese traders. The United States has excessive expectations., he said. To stabilize supply-demand relations which have been disrupted by excess inventories since 1985 will take some time. He also said that U.S. firms had not been aggressive enough in trying to sell in the Japanese market.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/The_Daily_Jakarta_Shimbun	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Yomiuri_Shimbun	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Jimmin_Shimbun	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Kobe_Shimbun	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mainichi_Shimbun	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Kyoto_Shimbun	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Nikkan_Kogyo_Shimbun	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Jōmō_Shimbun	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Nikkey_Shimbun	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hokkaido_Shimbun
Buenos Aires province	649	670	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Buenos_Aires_Province	Argentine grain producers adjusted their yield estimates for the 1986/87 coarse grain crop downward in the week to yesterday after the heavy rains at the end of March and beginning of April, trade sources said. They said sunflower, maize and sorghum production estimates had been reduced despite some later warm, dry weather, which has allowed a return to harvesting in some areas. However, as showers fell intermittently after last weekend, producers feared another spell of prolonged and intense rain could cause more damage to crops already badly hit this season. Rains in the middle of last week reached an average of 27 millimetres in parts of Buenos Aires province, 83 mm in Cordoba, 41 in Santa Fe, 50 in Entre Rios and Misiones, 95 in Corrientes, eight in Chaco and 35 in Formosa. There was no rainfall in the same period in La Pampa. Producers feared continued damp conditions could produce rotting and lead to still lower yield estimates for all the crops, including soybean. However, as the lands began drying later in the week harvesting advanced considerably, reaching between 36 and 40 pct of the area sown in the case of sunflower. Deterioration of the sunflower crop evident in harvested material in Cordoba, La Pampa and Buenos Aires forced yield estimates per hectare to be adjusted down again. The seasons sunflowerseed production is now forecast at 2.1 mln to 2.3 mln tonnes, against 2.2 mln to 2.4 mln forecast last week and down 43.9 to 48.8 pct on the 1985/86 record of 4.1 mln. Area sown to sunflowers was two to 2.2 mln hectares, 29.9 to 36.3 pct below the record 3.14 mln hectares last season. Maize harvesting has also reached 36 to 40 pct of the area sown. It is near completion in Cordoba and Santa Fe and will begin in La Pampa and southern Buenos Aires later in April. Production estimates for maize were down from last week at 9.5 mln to 9.8 mln tonnes, against 9.6 mln to 9.9 mln estimated previously. This is 22.2 to 23.4 pct below the 12.4 mln to 12.6 mln tonnes estimated by private sources for the 1985/86 crop and 21.9 to 25.8 pct down on the official figure of 12.8 mln tonnes. Maize was sown on 3.58 mln to 3.78 mln hectares, two to seven pct down on last seasons 3.85 mln. Sorghum was harvested on 23 to 25 pct of the area sown in Cordoba, Santa Fe and Chaco. Harvest will start in La Pampa and Buenos Aires in mid-April. The total area sown was 1.23 mln to 1.30 mln hectares, 10.3 to 15.2 pct down on the 1.45 mln sown last season. The new forecast for the sorghum crop is 2.9 mln to 3.2 mln tonnes compared with three mln to 3.3 mln forecast last week, and is 23.8 to 29.3 pct down on last seasons 4.1 mln to 4.2 mln tonne crop. The soybean crop for this season was not adjusted, remaining at a record 7.5 mln to 7.7 mln tonnes, up 4.2 to 5.5 pct on the 7.2 mln to 7.3 mln estimated by private sources for 1985/86 and 5.6 to 8.5 pct higher than the official figure of 7.1 mln. The area sown to soybeans this season was a record 3.7 mln to 3.8 mln hectares, 10.8 to 13.8 pct up on the record 3.34 mln sown in 1985/86. The soybean crop is showing excessive moisture in some areas and producers fear they may discover more damage. Some experimental harvesting was carried out in Santa Fe on areas making up only about one pct of the total crop but details on this were not available. Preparation of the fields for the 1987/88 wheat crop, which will be sown between May and August or September, has so far not been as intense as in previous years.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Southern_Province_Railway	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cherna,_Dobrich_Province	http://dbpedia.org/resource/List_of_municipalities_in_Siirt_Province	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Shamsabad_Rural_District_(Khuzestan_Province)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Wangdue_Phodrang_Province	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Uttaradit_Province	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Entre_Ríos_-_Rodolfo_Walsh_(Buenos_Aires_Underground)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/El_Seibo_Province	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Eastern_Province,_Rwanda	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Draganovo,_Veliko_Tarnovo_Province

Armen	4992	4997	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Garo_H._Armen	Cheap oil feedstocks, the weakened U.S. dollar and a plant utilization rate approaching 90 pct will propel the streamlined U.S. petrochemical industry to record profits this year, with growth expected through at least 1990, major company executives predicted. This bullish outlook for chemical manufacturing and an industrywide move to shed unrelated businesses has prompted GAF Corp (GAF), privately-held Cain Chemical Inc, and other firms to aggressively seek acquisitions of petrochemical plants. Oil companies such as Ashland Oil Inc (ASH), the Kentucky-based oil refiner and marketer, are also shopping for money-making petrochemical businesses to buy. I see us poised at the threshold of a golden period, said Paul Oreffice, chairman of giant Dow Chemical Co (DOW), adding, Theres no major plant capacity being added around the world now. The whole game is bringing out new products and improving the old ones. Analysts say the chemical industrys biggest customers, automobile manufacturers and home builders that use a lot of paints and plastics, are expected to buy quantities this year. U.S. petrochemical plants are currently operating at about 90 pct capacity, reflecting tighter supply that could hike product prices by 30 to 40 pct this year, said John Dosher, managing director of Pace Consultants Inc of Houston. Demand for some products such as styrene could push profit margins up by as much as 300 pct, he said. Oreffice, speaking at a meeting of chemical engineers in Houston, said Dow would easily top the 741 mln dlrs it earned last year and predicted it would have the best year in its history. In 1985, when oil prices were still above 25 dlrs a barrel and chemical exports were adversely affected by the strong U.S. dollar, Dow had profits of 58 mln dlrs. I believe the entire chemical industry is headed for a record year or close to it, Oreffice said. GAF chairman Samuel Heyman estimated that the U.S. chemical industry would report a 20 pct gain in profits during 1987. Last year, the domestic industry earned a total of 13 billion dlrs, a 54 pct leap from 1985. The turn in the fortunes of the once-sickly chemical industry has been brought about by a combination of luck and planning, said Paces John Dosher. Dosher said last years fall in oil prices made feedstocks dramatically cheaper and at the same time the American dollar was weakening against foreign currencies. That helped boost U.S. chemical exports. Also helping to bring supply and demand into balance has been the gradual market absorption of the extra chemical manufacturing capacity created by Middle Eastern oil producers in the early 1980s. Finally, virtually all major U.S. chemical manufacturers have embarked on an extensive corporate restructuring program to mothball inefficient plants, trim the payroll and eliminate unrelated businesses. The restructuring touched off a flurry of friendly and hostile takeover attempts. GAF, which made an unsuccessful attempt in 1985 to acquire Union Carbide Corp UK, recently offered three billion dlrs for Borg Warner Corp BOR, a Chicago manufacturer of plastics and chemicals. Another industry powerhouse, W.R. Grace (GRA) has divested its retailing, restaurant and fertilizer businesses to raise cash for chemical acquisitions. But some experts worry that the chemical industry may be headed for trouble if companies continue turning their back on the manufacturing of staple petrochemical commodities, such as ethylene, in favor of more profitable specialty chemicals that are custom-designed for a small group of buyers. Companies like DuPont (DD) and Monsanto Co MTC spent the past two or three years trying to get out of the commodity chemical business in reaction to how badly the market had deteriorated, Dosher said. But I think they will eventually kill the margins on the profitable chemicals in the niche market. Some top chemical executives share the concern. The challenge for our industry is to keep from getting carried away and repeating past mistakes, GAFs Heyman cautioned. The shift from commodity chemicals may be ill-advised. Specialty businesses do not stay special long. Houston-based Cain Chemical, created this month by the Sterling investment banking group, believes it can generate 700 mln dlrs in annual sales by bucking the industry trend. Chairman Gordon Cain, who previously led a leveraged buyout of Duponts Conoco Incs chemical business, has spent 1.1 billion dlrs since January to buy seven petrochemical plants along the Texas Gulf Coast. The plants produce only basic commodity petrochemicals that are the building blocks of specialty products. This kind of commodity chemical business will never be a glamorous, high-margin business, Cain said, adding that demand is expected to grow by about three pct annually. Garo Armen, an analyst with Dean Witter Reynolds, said chemical makers have also benefitted by increasing demand for plastics as prices become more competitive with aluminum, wood and steel products. Armen estimated the upturn in the chemical business could last as long as four or five years, provided the U.S. economy continues its modest rate of growth.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Armen_Gevorgyan	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Armen_Dzhigarkhanyan	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Armen_Babakhanian	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Armen_Nazaryan_(judoka)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Armen_Margarian	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Armen_Poghosyan	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Armen_Petrosyan_(actor)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Armen_Gilliam	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Armen_Ra	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Armen_Stepanyan
Dominion Textiles Inc	341	362	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dominion_Textile	The largest U.S. textile maker focused on its own business as its competitors found merger partners, but now Burlington Industries Inc may have restructured itself into an attractive takeover candidate, analysts said. The takeover spotlight fell today on Burlington, which rose 4-7/8 to 52-7/8 on speculation that investor Asher Edelman and Dominion Textiles Inc of Canada bought an almost five pct stake. A published report said Edelman and Dominion jointly acquired a stake in Burlington and were weighing a takeover offer. Edelman would not comment, and a spokesman for Montreal-based Dominion called the report just rumors. Burlington said it did not know if the report was true. Wall Street professionals said they were not convinced of the story or that Edelman and Dominion would be the victors if Burlington actually came into play. Arbitragers said past comments from Dominion, however, added credence to the speculation. Dominion has said that it was looking for a takeover in the U.S. Last year, Dominion unsuccessfully bid for Avondale Mills and has maintained a 120 mln dlr line of credit to be used for a U.S. acquisition. A Dominion spokesman said Canadas largest textile producer has been negotiating with many U.S. textile companies, but would not say whether Burlington was among them. There have been acquisitions in this area. Its not unusual that someone could be looking at Burlington after the housecleaning theyve done, said Eileen Gormley of Thomson McKinnon. Burlington sold its domestic operations, which made sheets and other linens, to J.P. Stevens and Co Inc for 110 mln dlrs last year. It also has reorganized management, and focused its operations on businesses that would be less affected by foreign competition, Gormley said. Theyve pulled back so as not to be a commodity marketer, said Gormley. She said in moving more heavily into industrial fabrics, Burlington bought C.H. Masland, which supplies carpets and other fabric to the auto industry. In the past, they just spent and never realized the return on the outlays they did make, she said. You look at their record over the year, and I think theyre poised to be more profitable than they had been in the past, Gormley said. She estimated 1987 earnings of 2.50 dlrs per share, up from 2.01 dlrs per share. Some analysts today recommended clients not buy Burlington at its current levels. Edward Johnson of Johnson Redbook said he recommends selling. He said he believes the stock is worth only about 50 dlrs on a takeover basis and about 46 dlrs on an earnings basis. Some arbitragers, however, said takeover values have been placed on the company of 60 to 65 dlrs per share. After Ashers (Edelman) recent history, a lot of people dont find him very credible anymore, said one arbitrager. Another, however, said Edelman succeeds in forcing managements to take steps to enhance shareholder values even if he doesnt win the target company. Edelman was unsuccessful last year in offers for Lucky Stores Inc and Fruehauf Corp. He did succeed in buying Ponderosa Inc. The stocks of other textile makers rose along with Burlington. J.P. Stevens STN climbed 5/8 to 44-7/8, and Fieldcrest Cannon Inc FLD, the result of a merger of Fieldcrest and Cannon, rose 1-1/8 to 39-3/4. West Point-Pepperell Inc WPM rose 1-7/8 to 67-1/8.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Metro_San_Diego_Communications_Inc.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Textile,_Clothing_and_Footwear_Union_of_Australia	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Underground_Productions,_Inc.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Progress_Energy_Inc	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ridley_Inc.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Red_Hat,_Inc._v._SCO_Group,_Inc.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Danger_Inc.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dominion_coalfield	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mendel_Biotechnology,_Inc.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Garage_Inc.

Brazil	211	217	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Brazil	J.P. Morgan and Co Inc said its first-quarter earnings fell by 3.2 pct, largely reflecting its previously announced decision to place on non-accrual status its 1.3 billion dlrs of medium- and long-term loans to Brazil. That decision, spurred by Brazils suspension of interest payments on February 20, reduced the quarters net income by 20 mln dlrs to 226.4 mln dlrs, compared with 233.9 mln in the first three months of 1986. Morgan also reported a loss of 1.8 mln dlrs from securities underwriting and trading, in contrast to a gain of 45.4 mln dlrs in the year-earlier period. In the fourth quarter of 1986, Morgan posted other trading losses of 5.5 mln dlrs because of setbacks in the trading and underwriting of Euromarket securities. Conditions in some sectors of the Euromarket remained difficult last quarter, with floating rate notes suffering heavy price falls, but a spokeswoman was unable to say whether Morgans trading losses were restricted to the Euromarket. On the positive side, Morgan reduced its provision for loan losses to 35 mln dlrs from 70 mln a year earlier. Foreign exchange trading income rose to 82 mln dlrs from 72.6 mln and trust income increased to 95.9 mln dlrs from 75.9 mln. Morgan said other operating income, mainly fees and commissions, rose to 102.2 mln dlrs from 88.4 mln, but net investment securities gains dropped to 43.1 mln from 58.1 mln. Net interest earnings were 490.4 mln dlrs in the first quarter, down from 499.4 mln a year earlier, and net yield fell to 2.79 pct from 3.20 pct. If Brazil had not been placed on non-accrual, which means that interest can be recorded as income only when payments are actually received, net interest earnings would have been 525.9 mln dlrs and net yield 2.99 pct. If Brazil does not resume payments, 1987 net would be cut by 72 mln dlrs, Morgan added. After the provision for loan losses, Morgans allowance for credit losses at the end of March totaled 953 mln dlrs compared with 910 mln at end-1986 and 815 mln a year earlier. It reported net recoveries of six mln dlrs after charge-offs of eight mln, compared with net charge-offs of 49 mln dlrs after recoveries of three mln a year earlier. Excluding Brazil, non-accruing loans at quarters end were 583 mln dlrs, down from 633 mln at end-1986 and 684 mln a year earlier. Non-interest expenses rose to 371.1 mln dlrs from 303.5 mln dlrs, with more than half the increase related to personnel costs, Morgan said.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Humidity_Sounder_for_Brazil	http://dbpedia.org/resource/2014_FIFA_World_Cup_Brazil_(video_game)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/1977_in_Brazil	http://dbpedia.org/resource/PlayTV_(Brazil)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Formula_Renault_2.0_Brazil	http://dbpedia.org/resource/São_Paulo_Brazil_Temple	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Trains_to_Brazil	http://dbpedia.org/resource/List_of_lighthouses_in_Brazil	http://dbpedia.org/resource/1889_in_Brazil	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Argentina–Brazil_border

Preparation of the fields for the 1987/88 wheat crop, which will be sown between May and August or September, has so far not been as intense as in previous years.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/2007_ATP_Buenos_Aires	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Del_Aire,_California	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hurlingham,_Buenos_Aires	http://dbpedia.org/resource/2010_Copa_Petrobras_Buenos_Aires	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Buenos_Aires_tetra	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Aire_de_service	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Nueve_de_Julio,_Buenos_Aires	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Provincial_Route_2_(Buenos_Aires)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Lavalle_(Buenos_Aires_Underground)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Vast_Aire
Kiichi Miyazawa	413	428	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Kiichi_Miyazawa	Top officials of leading industrial nations arrived at the U.S. Treasury main building to begin a meeting of the Group of Five. Officials seen arriving by Reuter correspondents included West German Finance Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg and Bundesbank President Karl Otto Poehl, French Finance Minister Edouard Balladur and his central banker Jacques de Larosiere. Also seen arriving were Japanese Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa and Japans central bank governor Satoshi Sumita and British Chancellor of the Exchequer and central bank governor Robin Leigh Pemberton. There was no immediate sign of Italian or Canadian officials. Monetary sources have said a fully blown meeting of the Group of Seven is expected to begin around 3 p.m. local time (1900 gmt) and last at least until 6 p.m. (2200 gmt), when a communique is expected to be issued. Italian sources said Italian acting Finance Minister Giovanni Goria met Treasury Secretary James Baker last night. At those talks Baker apparently convinced Goria, who declined to attend the February meeting of the Group of Seven in Paris, that Italy would participate fully in any meaningful decisions.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Takashi_Miyazawa	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Kiichi_Nakai	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Michel_Miyazawa	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Kiichi_Kunimoto	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Yuki_Miyazawa	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Juri_Miyazawa	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Kiichi_Hasegawa	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Miyazawa_Flutes	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mutō_Kiichi	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Kazufumi_Miyazawa

Cannon	3228	3234	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cannon_Mills	The largest U.S. textile maker focused on its own business as its competitors found merger partners, but now Burlington Industries Inc may have restructured itself into an attractive takeover candidate, analysts said. The takeover spotlight fell today on Burlington, which rose 4-7/8 to 52-7/8 on speculation that investor Asher Edelman and Dominion Textiles Inc of Canada bought an almost five pct stake. A published report said Edelman and Dominion jointly acquired a stake in Burlington and were weighing a takeover offer. Edelman would not comment, and a spokesman for Montreal-based Dominion called the report just rumors. Burlington said it did not know if the report was true. Wall Street professionals said they were not convinced of the story or that Edelman and Dominion would be the victors if Burlington actually came into play. Arbitragers said past comments from Dominion, however, added credence to the speculation. Dominion has said that it was looking for a takeover in the U.S. Last year, Dominion unsuccessfully bid for Avondale Mills and has maintained a 120 mln dlr line of credit to be used for a U.S. acquisition. A Dominion spokesman said Canadas largest textile producer has been negotiating with many U.S. textile companies, but would not say whether Burlington was among them. There have been acquisitions in this area. Its not unusual that someone could be looking at Burlington after the housecleaning theyve done, said Eileen Gormley of Thomson McKinnon. Burlington sold its domestic operations, which made sheets and other linens, to J.P. Stevens and Co Inc for 110 mln dlrs last year. It also has reorganized management, and focused its operations on businesses that would be less affected by foreign competition, Gormley said. Theyve pulled back so as not to be a commodity marketer, said Gormley. She said in moving more heavily into industrial fabrics, Burlington bought C.H. Masland, which supplies carpets and other fabric to the auto industry. In the past, they just spent and never realized the return on the outlays they did make, she said. You look at their record over the year, and I think theyre poised to be more profitable than they had been in the past, Gormley said. She estimated 1987 earnings of 2.50 dlrs per share, up from 2.01 dlrs per share. Some analysts today recommended clients not buy Burlington at its current levels. Edward Johnson of Johnson Redbook said he recommends selling. He said he believes the stock is worth only about 50 dlrs on a takeover basis and about 46 dlrs on an earnings basis. Some arbitragers, however, said takeover values have been placed on the company of 60 to 65 dlrs per share. After Ashers (Edelman) recent history, a lot of people dont find him very credible anymore, said one arbitrager. Another, however, said Edelman succeeds in forcing managements to take steps to enhance shareholder values even if he doesnt win the target company. Edelman was unsuccessful last year in offers for Lucky Stores Inc and Fruehauf Corp. He did succeed in buying Ponderosa Inc. The stocks of other textile makers rose along with Burlington. J.P. Stevens STN climbed 5/8 to 44-7/8, and Fieldcrest Cannon Inc FLD, the result of a merger of Fieldcrest and Cannon, rose 1-1/8 to 39-3/4.

House Appropriations subcommittee on Treasury, Postal Service and General Government Appropriations	260	359	http://dbpedia.org/resource/United_States_House_Appropriations_Subcommittee_on_Financial_Services_and_General_Government	Office of Management and Budget Director James Miller said President Reagan will reject the tax increase called for in the House Budget Committees 1988 budget proposal which is before the House for a vote today. Its just completely unacceptable, Miller told a House Appropriations subcommittee on Treasury, Postal Service and General Government Appropriations. The plan, drafted by the Democratic-controlled Budget committee, calls for 22 billion dlrs in higher revenues, of which 18 billion would be from new taxes set by the tax-writing committees. The House committees budget proposal includes some increases in federal user fees as well as 18 billion dlrs in taxes. Miller warned that failure to reduce the federal deficit would jeopardize the U.S. economy. If we do not further reduce the deficit... we place this economic expansion that weve had in the last five years at risk, Miller told the subcommittee. The result of any kind of tax increase would be to increase substantially the prospects that the expansion would come to an end, Miller said.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Web_Registry_Service	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Crown_and_Thistle_Inn,_Monmouth	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Covariance_and_contravariance_(computer_science)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/General_Cigar_Company–Ansco_Camera_Factory_Building	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Love,_Honor,_and_Oh_Baby!	http://dbpedia.org/resource/The_Brahmin_and_the_Mongoose	http://dbpedia.org/resource/On_the_Banks_of_the_Old_Ponchartrain	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Kurashiki_University_of_Science_and_the_Arts	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ernest_Baxter_Fite_House	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Jehu_Reed_House

The Department of Trade and Industry said earlier it had concluded a memorandum of understanding with Japans Finance Ministry to swap supervisory and investigatory information. The agreement covers stocks, shares and government bonds, but not commodity futures, whose regulation in Japan does not come under the Finance Ministry. It therefore does not cover some transactions on the London International Financial Futures Exchange and the London commodities and metal exchanges. The DTI said it hoped to seek further understandings with other countries which met in the U.K. Last December. The meeting involved delegates from the U.K., Switzerland, the U.S., Canada, Australia, Hong Kong, Japan, France, West Germany and Holland. Government sources said the deal with Japan completes arrangements linking Tokyo, the U.S. And London. A U.K. Agreement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) was signed last September. Todays agreement will deal with requests for information on a case by case basis, U.K. Government sources said.

The journal also contains a signed editorial concluding that the new results mark a significant milestone in the search for a successful immunotherapy for cancer. Interleukin-2, also known as IL-2, is a substance naturally produced by living cells in the laboratory. The drug is controversial because it was widely praised as a promising cancer treatment in early reports on its effectiveness in late 1985, only to come under criticism a year later for its failure to live up to its promise and due to its ravaging side effects. One of the new studies, conducted by Dr. William West of Biotherapeutics Inc of Franklin, Tenn., is particularly significant because it found far fewer harsh side effects after it changed the way in which the drug is administered. In that study, researchers administered IL-2 to 48 cancer patients and found a 50-pct remission rate for kidney cancers and a 50 pct remission rate for melanoma, a type of skin cancer, according to Prudential-Bache Securities Stuart Weisbrod, who obtained the advance copy of the magazine. For rectal and colon cancer, the researchers found no remissions, but none of the 48 patients treated had side effects serious enough to be placed under intensive hospital care, according to the article. In the second study, whose principal author is Dr. Steven Rosenberg of the National Cancer Institute, researchers administered IL-2 to 157 cancer patients and found a 33 pct remission rate in cancers of the kidney, a 27 pct rate in melanomas and a 15 pct rate in cancers of the colon and rectum. In the National Cancer Institute trials, a total of four patients died, the magazine reported, confirming the harshness of the drugs side effects as originally administered. Perhaps we are at the end of the beginning of the search for successful immunotherapy for cancer, said the editorial, signed by John Durant of Philadelphias Chase Cancer Center. These observations reported by Rosenberg and West surely did not describe successful practical approaches ready for widespread applications in the therapy of cancer patients, the editorial said. On the other hand, if they reflect, as seems possible, a successful manipulation of the cellular immune system, then we may be near the end of our search for a meaningful direction in the immunuotherapy of cancer, the editorial concluded.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Coors_Events_Center	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Exhibition_Center_Station	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dodge_Center_High_School	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Store-and-forward_switching_center	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Fleet_and_Industrial_Supply_Center,_Oakland	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Center_City_Mall	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Center_for_the_Arts,_University_at_Buffalo	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Fells_Acres_Day_Care_Center_preschool_trial	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Naval_Surface_Warfare_Center_Dahlgren_Division	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Chase_River,_Nanaimo
Fleet Financial Group	0	21	http://dbpedia.org/resource/FleetBoston_Financial	Fleet Financial Group said its shareholders approved an increase in shares of the companys authorized common stock to 100,000,000 shares from 75,000,000 shares currently. The company said shareholders approved the move at the annual meeting in Providence today when the company reported that its first quarter earnings rose to 38.5 mln dlrs, or 73 cts a share, from 31.7 mln dlrs, or 60 cts a share, in the first quarter 1986. J. Terence Murray, chairman and president of Fleet Financial, said, Fleets mortgage banking activities in particular continued to produce signficant income increases (in the first quarter). Murray said Fleets mortgage servicing portfolio reached 22.1 billion dlrs by March 31, including 1.8 billion dlrs purchased in March.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Silhouettes_(dance_group)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/2007_Davis_Cup_World_Group	http://dbpedia.org/resource/The_Barrow_Group	http://dbpedia.org/resource/2013–14_Santosh_Trophy_Group_Stage	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Goodwill,_The_Amity_Group	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Group_of_184	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Murugappa_Group	http://dbpedia.org/resource/UEFA_Euro_2012_qualifying_Group_I	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Group_augmentation	http://dbpedia.org/resource/2014_FIFA_World_Cup_qualification_–_UEFA_Group_G
SFE	667	670	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Australian_Securities_Exchange	The Victorian Corporate Affairs Commission, CAC, said it had suspended the futures trading licence of G H Shintoh (Australia) Ltd after a receiver was appointed to the companys South Australian branch. The one month suspension followed consultation with the Sydney Futures Exchange, SFE, which was liaising with Shintoh concerning the open positions of its clients, the CAC said. The South Australian CAC had applied for the appointment of a receiver and manager over the Adelaide office of Shintoh, an associate member of the SFE, the CAC said. Shintohs is the first licence suspended under a Futures Industry Code introduced by Australian states from July 1, 1986, SFE chief executive Les Hosking told Reuters. Asiavest Pty Ltd, a commodities futures trader associated with Shintoh and incorporated in Queensland, was placed in receivership earlier this year, he said.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Godfrey_Isaacs	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Kölesd	http://dbpedia.org/resource/The_Man_Who_Loved_Clowns	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Glenglassaugh_distillery	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Fiskenes	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Argyle,_Nova_Scotia_(community)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/North_Island_brown_kiwi	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Jon_Stickley	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Chigasaki_Station	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Kalma_Underpass,_Lahore
West Germany	869	881	http://dbpedia.org/resource/West_Germany	Britain intends to negotiate further agreements on international securities regulation to match those now in force with the U.S. And Japan, government sources said. The Department of Trade and Industry said earlier it had concluded a memorandum of understanding with Japans Finance Ministry to swap supervisory and investigatory information. The agreement covers stocks, shares and government bonds, but not commodity futures, whose regulation in Japan does not come under the Finance Ministry. It therefore does not cover some transactions on the London International Financial Futures Exchange and the London commodities and metal exchanges. The DTI said it hoped to seek further understandings with other countries which met in the U.K. Last December. The meeting involved delegates from the U.K., Switzerland, the U.S., Canada, Australia, Hong Kong, Japan, France, West Germany and Holland. Government sources said the deal with Japan completes arrangements linking Tokyo, the U.S. And London. A U.K. Agreement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) was signed last September. Todays agreement will deal with requests for information on a case by case basis, U.K. Government sources said. It is not legally binding and comes into force immediately.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cholewy,_Warsaw_West_County	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ingrow_(West)_railway_station	http://dbpedia.org/resource/West_Indian_cricket_team_in_Kenya_in_2001	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dawson,_West_Virginia	http://dbpedia.org/resource/List_of_members_of_the_78th_West_Virginia_Senate	http://dbpedia.org/resource/300_West_Adams_Building	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Case_House_(Parkersburg,_West_Virginia)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/David_West_(basketball)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Qepchaq,_West_Azerbaijan	http://dbpedia.org/resource/World_College_West
Celanese	926	934	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Celanese	Hoechst Celanese Corp said it sent propsective customers a confidential report describing its polyester textile fiber facilities in North Carolina and South Carolina. The company did not disclose any prices. The report describes the facilities in Darlington County, S.C., and Fayetteville, N.C., the company said. The report also decribes related manufacturing, marketing, administrative and technical resources that could be made avialable to a buyer. Hoechst Celanese was formed Feb 27 by the merger of Celanese Corp and American Hoechst Corp. The merger took place after an agreement was reached with the Federal Trade Commission that certain domestic polyester textile fiber assets of the combined companies would be divested, it said. Hoechst Celanese said it has the option of divesting either the South Carolina facilities of the former American Hoechst or a package of polyester textile fiber facilities of the former Celanese.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Celanese_Theatre	http://dbpedia.org/resource/British_Celanese
La Pampa	833	841	http://dbpedia.org/resource/La_Pampa_Province	Argentine grain producers adjusted their yield estimates for the 1986/87 coarse grain crop downward in the week to yesterday after the heavy rains at the end of March and beginning of April, trade sources said. They said sunflower, maize and sorghum production estimates had been reduced despite some later warm, dry weather, which has allowed a return to harvesting in some areas. However, as showers fell intermittently after last weekend, producers feared another spell of prolonged and intense rain could cause more damage to crops already badly hit this season. Rains in the middle of last week reached an average of 27 millimetres in parts of Buenos Aires province, 83 mm in Cordoba, 41 in Santa Fe, 50 in Entre Rios and Misiones, 95 in Corrientes, eight in Chaco and 35 in Formosa. There was no rainfall in the same period in La Pampa. Producers feared continued damp conditions could produce rotting and lead to still lower yield estimates for all the crops, including soybean. However, as the lands began drying later in the week harvesting advanced considerably, reaching between 36 and 40 pct of the area sown in the case of sunflower. Deterioration of the sunflower crop evident in harvested material in Cordoba, La Pampa and Buenos Aires forced yield estimates per hectare to be adjusted down again. The seasons sunflowerseed production is now forecast at 2.1 mln to 2.3 mln tonnes, against 2.2 mln to 2.4 mln forecast last week and down 43.9 to 48.8 pct on the 1985/86 record of 4.1 mln. Area sown to sunflowers was two to 2.2 mln hectares, 29.9 to 36.3 pct below the record 3.14 mln hectares last season. Maize harvesting has also reached 36 to 40 pct of the area sown. It is near completion in Cordoba and Santa Fe and will begin in La Pampa and southern Buenos Aires later in April. Production estimates for maize were down from last week at 9.5 mln to 9.8 mln tonnes, against 9.6 mln to 9.9 mln estimated previously. This is 22.2 to 23.4 pct below the 12.4 mln to 12.6 mln tonnes estimated by private sources for the 1985/86 crop and 21.9 to 25.8 pct down on the official figure of 12.8 mln tonnes. Maize was sown on 3.58 mln to 3.78 mln hectares, two to seven pct down on last seasons 3.85 mln. Sorghum was harvested on 23 to 25 pct of the area sown in Cordoba, Santa Fe and Chaco. Harvest will start in La Pampa and Buenos Aires in mid-April. The total area sown was 1.23 mln to 1.30 mln hectares, 10.3 to 15.2 pct down on the 1.45 mln sown last season. The new forecast for the sorghum crop is 2.9 mln to 3.2 mln tonnes compared with three mln to 3.3 mln forecast last week, and is 23.8 to 29.3 pct down on last seasons 4.1 mln to 4.2 mln tonne crop. The soybean crop for this season was not adjusted, remaining at a record 7.5 mln to 7.7 mln tonnes, up 4.2 to 5.5 pct on the 7.2 mln to 7.3 mln estimated by private sources for 1985/86 and 5.6 to 8.5 pct higher than the official figure of 7.1 mln. The area sown to soybeans this season was a record 3.7 mln to 3.8 mln hectares, 10.8 to 13.8 pct up on the record 3.34 mln sown in 1985/86. The soybean crop is showing excessive moisture in some areas and producers fear they may discover more damage. Some experimental harvesting was carried out in Santa Fe on areas making up only about one pct of the total crop but details on this were not available. Preparation of the fields for the 1987/88 wheat crop, which will be sown between May and August or September, has so far not been as intense as in previous years.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/La_Neuville-du-Bosc	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Communauté_de_communes_de_la_Septaine	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Monté_la_riviè	http://dbpedia.org/resource/La_Nueva_España	http://dbpedia.org/resource/La_Bohème_(2008_film)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/La_Salle,_Aosta_Valley	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Nosotras_las_Taquígrafas	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Friedrich_de_la_Motte_Fouqué	http://dbpedia.org/resource/La_Belle_Meunière	http://dbpedia.org/resource/La_Mancha_Negra
Houston	1319	1326	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Houston	Cheap oil feedstocks, the weakened U.S. dollar and a plant utilization rate approaching 90 pct will propel the streamlined U.S. petrochemical industry to record profits this year, with growth expected through at least 1990, major company executives predicted. This bullish outlook for chemical manufacturing and an industrywide move to shed unrelated businesses has prompted GAF Corp (GAF), privately-held Cain Chemical Inc, and other firms to aggressively seek acquisitions of petrochemical plants. Oil companies such as Ashland Oil Inc (ASH), the Kentucky-based oil refiner and marketer, are also shopping for money-making petrochemical businesses to buy. I see us poised at the threshold of a golden period, said Paul Oreffice, chairman of giant Dow Chemical Co (DOW), adding, Theres no major plant capacity being added around the world now. The whole game is bringing out new products and improving the old ones. Analysts say the chemical industrys biggest customers, automobile manufacturers and home builders that use a lot of paints and plastics, are expected to buy quantities this year. U.S. petrochemical plants are currently operating at about 90 pct capacity, reflecting tighter supply that could hike product prices by 30 to 40 pct this year, said John Dosher, managing director of Pace Consultants Inc of Houston. Demand for some products such as styrene could push profit margins up by as much as 300 pct, he said. Oreffice, speaking at a meeting of chemical engineers in Houston, said Dow would easily top the 741 mln dlrs it earned last year and predicted it would have the best year in its history. In 1985, when oil prices were still above 25 dlrs a barrel and chemical exports were adversely affected by the strong U.S. dollar, Dow had profits of 58 mln dlrs. I believe the entire chemical industry is headed for a record year or close to it, Oreffice said. GAF chairman Samuel Heyman estimated that the U.S. chemical industry would report a 20 pct gain in profits during 1987. Last year, the domestic industry earned a total of 13 billion dlrs, a 54 pct leap from 1985. The turn in the fortunes of the once-sickly chemical industry has been brought about by a combination of luck and planning, said Paces John Dosher. Dosher said last years fall in oil prices made feedstocks dramatically cheaper and at the same time the American dollar was weakening against foreign currencies. That helped boost U.S. chemical exports. Also helping to bring supply and demand into balance has been the gradual market absorption of the extra chemical manufacturing capacity created by Middle Eastern oil producers in the early 1980s. Finally, virtually all major U.S. chemical manufacturers have embarked on an extensive corporate restructuring program to mothball inefficient plants, trim the payroll and eliminate unrelated businesses. The restructuring touched off a flurry of friendly and hostile takeover attempts. GAF, which made an unsuccessful attempt in 1985 to acquire Union Carbide Corp UK, recently offered three billion dlrs for Borg Warner Corp BOR, a Chicago manufacturer of plastics and chemicals. Another industry powerhouse, W.R. Grace (GRA) has divested its retailing, restaurant and fertilizer businesses to raise cash for chemical acquisitions. But some experts worry that the chemical industry may be headed for trouble if companies continue turning their back on the manufacturing of staple petrochemical commodities, such as ethylene, in favor of more profitable specialty chemicals that are custom-designed for a small group of buyers. Companies like DuPont (DD) and Monsanto Co MTC spent the past two or three years trying to get out of the commodity chemical business in reaction to how badly the market had deteriorated, Dosher said. But I think they will eventually kill the margins on the profitable chemicals in the niche market. Some top chemical executives share the concern. The challenge for our industry is to keep from getting carried away and repeating past mistakes, GAFs Heyman cautioned. The shift from commodity chemicals may be ill-advised. Specialty businesses do not stay special long. Houston-based Cain Chemical, created this month by the Sterling investment banking group, believes it can generate 700 mln dlrs in annual sales by bucking the industry trend. Chairman Gordon Cain, who previously led a leveraged buyout of Duponts Conoco Incs chemical business, has spent 1.1 billion dlrs since January to buy seven petrochemical plants along the Texas Gulf Coast. The plants produce only basic commodity petrochemicals that are the building blocks of specialty products. This kind of commodity chemical business will never be a glamorous, high-margin business, Cain said, adding that demand is expected to grow by about three pct annually. Garo Armen, an analyst with Dean Witter Reynolds, said chemical makers have also benefitted by increasing demand for plastics as prices become more competitive with aluminum, wood and steel products. Armen estimated the upturn in the chemical business could last as long as four or five years, provided the U.S. economy continues its modest rate of growth.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dwight_D._Eisenhower_Park_(Houston)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Immanuel_Lutheran_Church_(Houston)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/List_of_Sam_Houston_State_University_alumni	http://dbpedia.org/resource/List_of_Houston_Texans_seasons	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Houston_mayoral_election,_2009	http://dbpedia.org/resource/All_at_Once_(Whitney_Houston_song)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/2002–03_Houston_Rockets_season	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Uptown_Houston	http://dbpedia.org/resource/S._H._Kress_and_Co._Building_(Houston)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/North_Houston,_Texas

Georgia power	992	1005	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Georgia_Power	An audit submitted to the Georgia Public Service Commission claims that between 944 mln dlrs and 1.8 billion dlrs of the costs of the Plant Vogtle nuclear power station should be disallowed, a Southern Co spokeswoman said. Southerns Georgia Power Co subsidiary has a 45.7 pct interest in the plant and estimated earlier this year it would cost a total of 8.87 billion dlrs. Last year, the plants owners pledged to Georgia regulators they would limit the cost passed on to rate payers to 8.4 billion dlrs. The Southern spokeswoman said the company feels the report by OBrien-Kreitzberg is flawed and biased. She said the report was released yesterday by the state attorney general. Responding to the report today, Georgia Power Chairman Robert W. Scherer told a news conference the conclusions drawn by the firm are not only wrong -- they also reflect the same bias against nuclear power that these auditors have demonstrated in similar cases accross the country. Saying he was not suggesting Georgia power was without fault, Scherer said the audit identified several things I wish we had done differently. Scherer pointed out a report OBrien-Kreitzberg submitted to Georgia regulators in March 1986 projected Georgia Power would not finish Plant Vogtle unit one before the end of 1987. Noting unit one is finished, and we expect it to be in commercial operationg by June, he said the firms latest report ignored the earlier projection, gave the utility no credit for the completion and actually penalized us by suggesting that costs to maintain t he schedule be disallowed. Scherer said the latest audit alleges Georgia Power could have saved 95 mln dlrs if it had stopped using four shifts, seven days a week to speed construction three years sooner. He said this would have delayed completion of the plant for another year and it would have cost several hunderd million dlrs more. Noting the audit said costs were increased 600 mln dlrs by schedule delays totaling 20.5 months, he said First, we have the best concrete placement record in the industry, Second new government regulations after the Three Mile Island incident significantly increased construction time.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Georgia_State_Route_260	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Simon_Power_(composer)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Georgia_Right_to_Life	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Asnæs_Power_Station	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Rest_Haven,_Georgia	http://dbpedia.org/resource/John_E._Amos_Power_Plant	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Economics_of_nuclear_power_plants	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Evil_Power	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Swedish_nuclear_power_referendum,_1980	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Meaford_Power_Station
Japan	1808	1813	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Japan	Senior Japanese officials tomorrow open talks with American trade negotiators in a last-ditch effort to avert new high U.S. tariffs to be imposed on a wide variety of Japanese electronic exports. Makoto Kuroda, vice minister of Japans Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI), is to hold two days of meetings with the Deputy U.S. Trade Representative, Michael Smith, and the Under Secretary of Commerce, Bruce Smart. The new tariffs, to go into effect on April 17, are in retaliation for Japans failure to adhere to an agreement to end dumping semiconductors in world markets at below cost and to open its home market to U.S. semiconductor shipments. They are to be imposed on goods which use semiconductors, including television and audio equipment and computers. Both U.S. and Japanese officials have said there was little likelihood the talks would do anything to avert the 100 pct duties on 300 mln dlrs worth of Japanese shipments. President Reagan announced the planned tariffs on March 27 after he said that close monitoring of the July 1986 U.S.-Japanese semiconductor pact convinced U.S. officials that Japan was not honoring the agreement. In making the annoucement, Reagan said I am committed to the full enforcement of our trade agreements designed to provide American industry with free and fair trade. Trade analysts said his move was aimed as much at Japans semiconductor trade practices, which are said to have injured the U.S. semiconductor industry, as Congress, which has complained about presidential timidity on trade issues. Congressional Democrats have pledged to enact aggressive trade laws to counter what they contend has been Reagans inaction to redress the growing U.S. trade deficit, which last year reached 169.8 billion dlrs. About one-third of the deficit was with Japan. Reagan said there were recent signs Japan was beginning to adhere to the pact and that was why he was not terminating it. Kuroda said on leaving Tokyo today he had no new proposals but did have an explanation of the semiconductor situation.

Britain	0	7	http://dbpedia.org/resource/United_Kingdom	Britain intends to negotiate further agreements on international securities regulation to match those now in force with the U.S. And Japan, government sources said. The Department of Trade and Industry said earlier it had concluded a memorandum of understanding with Japans Finance Ministry to swap supervisory and investigatory information. The agreement covers stocks, shares and government bonds, but not commodity futures, whose regulation in Japan does not come under the Finance Ministry. It therefore does not cover some transactions on the London International Financial Futures Exchange and the London commodities and metal exchanges. The DTI said it hoped to seek further understandings with other countries which met in the U.K. Last December. The meeting involved delegates from the U.K., Switzerland, the U.S., Canada, Australia, Hong Kong, Japan, France, West Germany and Holland. Government sources said the deal with Japan completes arrangements linking Tokyo, the U.S. And London. A U.K. Agreement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) was signed last September. Todays agreement will deal with requests for information on a case by case basis, U.K. Government sources said. It is not legally binding and comes into force immediately.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/2nd_century_in_Roman_Britain	http://dbpedia.org/resource/List_of_the_vascular_plants_of_Britain_and_Ireland_5	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Great_Britain_at_the_2007_UCI_Road_World_Championships	http://dbpedia.org/resource/List_of_former_cathedrals_in_Great_Britain	http://dbpedia.org/resource/East_New_Britain_Province	http://dbpedia.org/resource/2015–16_Great_Britain_and_Ireland_floods	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Society_of_Artists_of_Great_Britain	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Horrible_Histories:_Barmy_Britain	http://dbpedia.org/resource/List_of_bees_of_Great_Britain	http://dbpedia.org/resource/List_of_ambassadors_of_Great_Britain_to_Russia

Federal member of parliament for the region,  Charles-Eugene Marin, said last week the federal government is also prepared to provide financial help to restart operations as soon as possible. Noranda has estimated damage from the fire at about 10 mln dlrs and a company spokesman said it should have a more specific estimate by the end of the month. Noranda said it had hoped to have an estimate sooner, but has found that it will take longer than expected to gain access to the burned-out area. Noranda said the mine was not insured.  said the mine was not insured.

New England Journal of Medicine	171	202	http://dbpedia.org/resource/The_New_England_Journal_of_Medicine	Promising new findings in the use of a controversial experimental drug called Interleukin-2 as a cure for cancer will be published in the April 9 issue of the prestigious New England Journal of Medicine, according to a Wall Street analyst who has obtained an advance copy of the magazine. Among interleukins principal U. S. makers are Cetus Corp CTUS, headquartered in Emeryville, Calif., and Immunex Corp IMNX, based in Seattle, Wash. The journal, to be released late today, contains two articles reporting high remission rates several cancer types. The journal also contains a signed editorial concluding that the new results mark a significant milestone in the search for a successful immunotherapy for cancer. Interleukin-2, also known as IL-2, is a substance naturally produced by living cells in the laboratory. The drug is controversial because it was widely praised as a promising cancer treatment in early reports on its effectiveness in late 1985, only to come under criticism a year later for its failure to live up to its promise and due to its ravaging side effects. One of the new studies, conducted by Dr. William West of Biotherapeutics Inc of Franklin, Tenn., is particularly significant because it found far fewer harsh side effects after it changed the way in which the drug is administered. In that study, researchers administered IL-2 to 48 cancer patients and found a 50-pct remission rate for kidney cancers and a 50 pct remission rate for melanoma, a type of skin cancer, according to Prudential-Bache Securities Stuart Weisbrod, who obtained the advance copy of the magazine. For rectal and colon cancer, the researchers found no remissions, but none of the 48 patients treated had side effects serious enough to be placed under intensive hospital care, according to the article. In the second study, whose principal author is Dr. Steven Rosenberg of the National Cancer Institute, researchers administered IL-2 to 157 cancer patients and found a 33 pct remission rate in cancers of the kidney, a 27 pct rate in melanomas and a 15 pct rate in cancers of the colon and rectum. In the National Cancer Institute trials, a total of four patients died, the magazine reported, confirming the harshness of the drugs side effects as originally administered. Perhaps we are at the end of the beginning of the search for successful immunotherapy for cancer, said the editorial, signed by John Durant of Philadelphias Chase Cancer Center. These observations reported by Rosenberg and West surely did not describe successful practical approaches ready for widespread applications in the therapy of cancer patients, the editorial said. On the other hand, if they reflect, as seems possible, a successful manipulation of the cellular immune system, then we may be near the end of our search for a meaningful direction in the immunuotherapy of cancer, the editorial concluded.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/1950_All_England_Badminton_Championships	http://dbpedia.org/resource/National_Association_of_Educational_Broadcasters	http://dbpedia.org/resource/New_School_Rome	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Catalogue_of_spectroscopic_binary_orbits	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Otaki,_New_Zealand	http://dbpedia.org/resource/List_of_battles_involving_the_French_Foreign_Legion	http://dbpedia.org/resource/List_of_Google_April_Fools'_Day_jokes	http://dbpedia.org/resource/List_of_listed_buildings_in_Keig,_Aberdeenshire	http://dbpedia.org/resource/New_Puritans	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Boston_Society_of_Film_Critics_Awards_1985
Georgia Power	1612	1625	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Georgia_Power	An audit submitted to the Georgia Public Service Commission claims that between 944 mln dlrs and 1.8 billion dlrs of the costs of the Plant Vogtle nuclear power station should be disallowed, a Southern Co spokeswoman said. Southerns Georgia Power Co subsidiary has a 45.7 pct interest in the plant and estimated earlier this year it would cost a total of 8.87 billion dlrs. Last year, the plants owners pledged to Georgia regulators they would limit the cost passed on to rate payers to 8.4 billion dlrs. The Southern spokeswoman said the company feels the report by OBrien-Kreitzberg is flawed and biased. She said the report was released yesterday by the state attorney general. Responding to the report today, Georgia Power Chairman Robert W. Scherer told a news conference the conclusions drawn by the firm are not only wrong -- they also reflect the same bias against nuclear power that these auditors have demonstrated in similar cases accross the country. Saying he was not suggesting Georgia power was without fault, Scherer said the audit identified several things I wish we had done differently. Scherer pointed out a report OBrien-Kreitzberg submitted to Georgia regulators in March 1986 projected Georgia Power would not finish Plant Vogtle unit one before the end of 1987. Noting unit one is finished, and we expect it to be in commercial operationg by June, he said the firms latest report ignored the earlier projection, gave the utility no credit for the completion and actually penalized us by suggesting that costs to maintain t he schedule be disallowed. Scherer said the latest audit alleges Georgia Power could have saved 95 mln dlrs if it had stopped using four shifts, seven days a week to speed construction three years sooner. He said this would have delayed completion of the plant for another year and it would have cost several hunderd million dlrs more. Noting the audit said costs were increased 600 mln dlrs by schedule delays totaling 20.5 months, he said First, we have the best concrete placement record in the industry, Second new government regulations after the Three Mile Island incident significantly increased construction time.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Nelson,_Georgia	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Andhra_Pradesh_Central_Power_Distribution_Company	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Poihipi_Power_Station	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Spencer_High_School_(Columbus,_Georgia)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pinjar_Power_Station	http://dbpedia.org/resource/FlexGen_Power_Systems	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bhadradri_Thermal_Power_Plant	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Leland_T._Powers	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Telangana_State_Southern_Power_Distribution_Company_Limited	http://dbpedia.org/resource/New_Georgia_counterattack

It simply isnt something that we are planning to do, the official said. He added the Treasury was aware of Japanese news reports suggesting the Reagan administration might issue such bonds as the former Carter administration did when it sold Carter bonds denominated in West German marks. But he said the situation was greatly different now. If you look at the differences between the treasury market now and in the Carter administration years, it is a much more global market now, the official said. There was not the same ease then for the holder of another currency to buy other countries securities, he added, But there is no difficulty now for them to purchase dollars and buy U.S. securities. The United States needs dollars, not Japanese yen, to pay its debts and reduce the deficit and so has no plans to issue yen-denominated bonds, he emphasized.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Treasury_Hotel	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Symbols_of_the_United_States_Department_of_the_Treasury	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sicyonian_Treasury	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Treasury-class_cutter	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tosa_Yamauchi_Family_Treasury_and_Archives	http://dbpedia.org/resource/The_Treasury_(store)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Treasury_test_discount_rate	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Short_Trips:_A_Christmas_Treasury	http://dbpedia.org/resource/United_States_Deputy_Secretary_of_the_Treasury	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Treasury_Holdings

Brazil	1748	1754	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Brazil	J.P. Morgan and Co Inc said its first-quarter earnings fell by 3.2 pct, largely reflecting its previously announced decision to place on non-accrual status its 1.3 billion dlrs of medium- and long-term loans to Brazil. That decision, spurred by Brazils suspension of interest payments on February 20, reduced the quarters net income by 20 mln dlrs to 226.4 mln dlrs, compared with 233.9 mln in the first three months of 1986. Morgan also reported a loss of 1.8 mln dlrs from securities underwriting and trading, in contrast to a gain of 45.4 mln dlrs in the year-earlier period. In the fourth quarter of 1986, Morgan posted other trading losses of 5.5 mln dlrs because of setbacks in the trading and underwriting of Euromarket securities. Conditions in some sectors of the Euromarket remained difficult last quarter, with floating rate notes suffering heavy price falls, but a spokeswoman was unable to say whether Morgans trading losses were restricted to the Euromarket. On the positive side, Morgan reduced its provision for loan losses to 35 mln dlrs from 70 mln a year earlier. Foreign exchange trading income rose to 82 mln dlrs from 72.6 mln and trust income increased to 95.9 mln dlrs from 75.9 mln. Morgan said other operating income, mainly fees and commissions, rose to 102.2 mln dlrs from 88.4 mln, but net investment securities gains dropped to 43.1 mln from 58.1 mln. Net interest earnings were 490.4 mln dlrs in the first quarter, down from 499.4 mln a year earlier, and net yield fell to 2.79 pct from 3.20 pct. If Brazil had not been placed on non-accrual, which means that interest can be recorded as income only when payments are actually received, net interest earnings would have been 525.9 mln dlrs and net yield 2.99 pct. If Brazil does not resume payments, 1987 net would be cut by 72 mln dlrs, Morgan added. After the provision for loan losses, Morgans allowance for credit losses at the end of March totaled 953 mln dlrs compared with 910 mln at end-1986 and 815 mln a year earlier. It reported net recoveries of six mln dlrs after charge-offs of eight mln, compared with net charge-offs of 49 mln dlrs after recoveries of three mln a year earlier. Excluding Brazil, non-accruing loans at quarters end were 583 mln dlrs, down from 633 mln at end-1986 and 684 mln a year earlier. Non-interest expenses rose to 371.1 mln dlrs from 303.5 mln dlrs, with more than half the increase related to personnel costs, Morgan said.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Brazil_national_roller_hockey_team	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Banana_production_in_Brazil	http://dbpedia.org/resource/List_of_number-one_albums_of_2009_(Brazil)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Rankings_of_universities_in_Brazil	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Brazil_at_the_1995_Pan_American_Games	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Itata_River_(Brazil)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cristal_Falls_(Brazil)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pentecostalism_in_Brazil	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Brazil–United_States_Treaty	http://dbpedia.org/resource/1918_in_Brazil

Burlington Industries	1080	1101	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Burlington_Industries	Dominion Textile Inc considers a published report that it has bought a stake in Burlington Industries Inc and is considering making a joint bid for the company to be a rumor, a company spokesman said. As far as I am concerned and the company is concerned, they are rumors and were not commenting on rumors, spokesman Michel Dufour told Reuters in response to a query. All the information that has been given out publicly is that, yes, Dominion Textile is interested in making an acquisition that big...probably based on that people are starting all sorts of rumors, he said. Dufour said yes when asked whether the report was only a rumor, but said the company was not prepared to comment further. Dominion Textile president and chairman Thomas Bell was out of town and unavailable for comment. Dominion Textile last year made an unsuccesful 104-mln- U.S.-dlr bid for Avondale Mills and has maintained a 120-mln- U.S.-dlr line of credit to be used for an American acquisition. Dufour said the company has been negotiating with many U.S. textile companies but would not say whether Burlington Industries was one of them. Burlingtons stock rose sharply this morning on the report, which said Dominion Textile had joined with U.S. investor Asher Edelman to buy a stake in the company and to consider making a takeover offer. Dominion Textile, which reported operating profit of 11.1 mln Canadian dlrs last year on sales of 926.5 mln dlrs, has repeatedly said it will concentrate on expanding into the U.S. The company has said it plans to diversify into new product and market areas in addition to expanding its textile operations.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Fujimoto_Photo_Industries_Co._Ltd.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mining_industry_of_Equatorial_Guinea	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Incobrasa_Industries	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sabah_Gas_Industries	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Visy_Industries	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cultural_Industries_Quarter	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Rural_Industries_Research_and_Development_Corporation	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Smokestack_industry	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Society_of_the_Plastics_Industry	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Burlington_South_(River_Line_station)

He said a public sale of 30 pct of DSMs assets in 1988 was not unlikely, but the timing of the sell-off was entirely in the hands of Parliament. Dutch Finance Minister Onno Ruding is known to be a proponent of privatisation, and the centre-right government coalition mentioned plans to privatise DSM in its policy declaration last autumn. Van Liemt would not speculate on a possible market price, but said his company had raised its total 1986 dividend to 98 mln guilders, almost 25 pct of 1986 net profit. We ought to be able to match our German competitors on price earnings ratio, although the Amsterdam bourse generally has a lower ratio than the worlds major exchanges,  he said. The average Dutch price/earnings ratio is 10.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/DSM_CC	http://dbpedia.org/resource/DSM-IV_codes	http://dbpedia.org/resource/DSM-5	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Homosexuality_in_DSM	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Structured_Clinical_Interview_for_DSM-IV

Chicago	3071	3078	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Chicago	Cheap oil feedstocks, the weakened U.S. dollar and a plant utilization rate approaching 90 pct will propel the streamlined U.S. petrochemical industry to record profits this year, with growth expected through at least 1990, major company executives predicted. This bullish outlook for chemical manufacturing and an industrywide move to shed unrelated businesses has prompted GAF Corp (GAF), privately-held Cain Chemical Inc, and other firms to aggressively seek acquisitions of petrochemical plants. Oil companies such as Ashland Oil Inc (ASH), the Kentucky-based oil refiner and marketer, are also shopping for money-making petrochemical businesses to buy. I see us poised at the threshold of a golden period, said Paul Oreffice, chairman of giant Dow Chemical Co (DOW), adding, Theres no major plant capacity being added around the world now. The whole game is bringing out new products and improving the old ones. Analysts say the chemical industrys biggest customers, automobile manufacturers and home builders that use a lot of paints and plastics, are expected to buy quantities this year. U.S. petrochemical plants are currently operating at about 90 pct capacity, reflecting tighter supply that could hike product prices by 30 to 40 pct this year, said John Dosher, managing director of Pace Consultants Inc of Houston. Demand for some products such as styrene could push profit margins up by as much as 300 pct, he said. Oreffice, speaking at a meeting of chemical engineers in Houston, said Dow would easily top the 741 mln dlrs it earned last year and predicted it would have the best year in its history. In 1985, when oil prices were still above 25 dlrs a barrel and chemical exports were adversely affected by the strong U.S. dollar, Dow had profits of 58 mln dlrs. I believe the entire chemical industry is headed for a record year or close to it, Oreffice said. GAF chairman Samuel Heyman estimated that the U.S. chemical industry would report a 20 pct gain in profits during 1987. Last year, the domestic industry earned a total of 13 billion dlrs, a 54 pct leap from 1985. The turn in the fortunes of the once-sickly chemical industry has been brought about by a combination of luck and planning, said Paces John Dosher. Dosher said last years fall in oil prices made feedstocks dramatically cheaper and at the same time the American dollar was weakening against foreign currencies. That helped boost U.S. chemical exports. Also helping to bring supply and demand into balance has been the gradual market absorption of the extra chemical manufacturing capacity created by Middle Eastern oil producers in the early 1980s. Finally, virtually all major U.S. chemical manufacturers have embarked on an extensive corporate restructuring program to mothball inefficient plants, trim the payroll and eliminate unrelated businesses. The restructuring touched off a flurry of friendly and hostile takeover attempts. GAF, which made an unsuccessful attempt in 1985 to acquire Union Carbide Corp UK, recently offered three billion dlrs for Borg Warner Corp BOR, a Chicago manufacturer of plastics and chemicals. Another industry powerhouse, W.R. Grace (GRA) has divested its retailing, restaurant and fertilizer businesses to raise cash for chemical acquisitions. But some experts worry that the chemical industry may be headed for trouble if companies continue turning their back on the manufacturing of staple petrochemical commodities, such as ethylene, in favor of more profitable specialty chemicals that are custom-designed for a small group of buyers. Companies like DuPont (DD) and Monsanto Co MTC spent the past two or three years trying to get out of the commodity chemical business in reaction to how badly the market had deteriorated, Dosher said. But I think they will eventually kill the margins on the profitable chemicals in the niche market. Some top chemical executives share the concern. The challenge for our industry is to keep from getting carried away and repeating past mistakes, GAFs Heyman cautioned. The shift from commodity chemicals may be ill-advised. Specialty businesses do not stay special long. Houston-based Cain Chemical, created this month by the Sterling investment banking group, believes it can generate 700 mln dlrs in annual sales by bucking the industry trend. Chairman Gordon Cain, who previously led a leveraged buyout of Duponts Conoco Incs chemical business, has spent 1.1 billion dlrs since January to buy seven petrochemical plants along the Texas Gulf Coast. The plants produce only basic commodity petrochemicals that are the building blocks of specialty products. This kind of commodity chemical business will never be a glamorous, high-margin business, Cain said, adding that demand is expected to grow by about three pct annually. Garo Armen, an analyst with Dean Witter Reynolds, said chemical makers have also benefitted by increasing demand for plastics as prices become more competitive with aluminum, wood and steel products. Armen estimated the upturn in the chemical business could last as long as four or five years, provided the U.S. economy continues its modest rate of growth.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Chicago_(CTA_Brown_and_Purple_Lines_station)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Edison_Park_(Chicago_park)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Chicago_Great_Western_Depot	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Chicago_stepping	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Material_Culture_of_the_Old_World_in_Chicago	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Chicago_Welsh_Societies	http://dbpedia.org/resource/List_of_Chicago_Cubs_no-hitters	http://dbpedia.org/resource/List_of_University_of_Chicago_people	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Chicago_railroad_strike_of_1877	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Social-Demokraten_(Chicago)

Georgia Public Service Commission	26	59	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Georgia_Public_Service_Commission	An audit submitted to the Georgia Public Service Commission claims that between 944 mln dlrs and 1.8 billion dlrs of the costs of the Plant Vogtle nuclear power station should be disallowed, a Southern Co spokeswoman said. Southerns Georgia Power Co subsidiary has a 45.7 pct interest in the plant and estimated earlier this year it would cost a total of 8.87 billion dlrs. Last year, the plants owners pledged to Georgia regulators they would limit the cost passed on to rate payers to 8.4 billion dlrs. The Southern spokeswoman said the company feels the report by OBrien-Kreitzberg is flawed and biased. She said the report was released yesterday by the state attorney general. Responding to the report today, Georgia Power Chairman Robert W. Scherer told a news conference the conclusions drawn by the firm are not only wrong -- they also reflect the same bias against nuclear power that these auditors have demonstrated in similar cases accross the country. Saying he was not suggesting Georgia power was without fault, Scherer said the audit identified several things I wish we had done differently. Scherer pointed out a report OBrien-Kreitzberg submitted to Georgia regulators in March 1986 projected Georgia Power would not finish Plant Vogtle unit one before the end of 1987. Noting unit one is finished, and we expect it to be in commercial operationg by June, he said the firms latest report ignored the earlier projection, gave the utility no credit for the completion and actually penalized us by suggesting that costs to maintain t he schedule be disallowed. Scherer said the latest audit alleges Georgia Power could have saved 95 mln dlrs if it had stopped using four shifts, seven days a week to speed construction three years sooner. He said this would have delayed completion of the plant for another year and it would have cost several hunderd million dlrs more. Noting the audit said costs were increased 600 mln dlrs by schedule delays totaling 20.5 months, he said First, we have the best concrete placement record in the industry, Second new government regulations after the Three Mile Island incident significantly increased construction time.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/National_Statistics_Office_of_Georgia	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Alaska_Reindeer_Service	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Reedy_Creek_Energy_Services	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Latino_Commission_on_AIDS	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Chapel_Hill_High_School_(Douglasville,_Georgia)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/2001_Georgia_Tech_Yellow_Jackets_football_team	http://dbpedia.org/resource/New_Jersey_Department_of_Law_and_Public_Safety	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Standing_Committee_on_Health_and_Care_Services	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Indianapolis_Public_School_Conference	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Grammar_public_school_rawalpindi

Agrimont SPA, the holding company for Montedisons Agro-Industrial businesses, had sales of 810 billion lire and a net profit of about 1.1 billion lire, after amortization costs of 35 billion lire and a 13 billion lire reduction in the value of inventory due to falling market prices, Montedison said. Agrimont, still wholly owned by Montedison, is taking steps to be traded on the Milan exchange, the company said. The company said that 1986 was characterized by an unstable fertlizer market due to the weak dollar and the decline of international prices for products sold in Europe and the U.S where Agrimont operates through its Conserv division.

Getty	729	734	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Getty_Oil	First Boston Corp analyst William Randol recommended the purchase of Texaco Inc today, saying the discount that investors have made in the share price to reflect the ongoing litigation with Pennzoil has been overdone relative to how we expect the case to conclude. Texacos stock rose 1/8 to 34-1/8. On Monday, the stock tumbled four points after the Supreme Court overturned a lower court decision that cut Texacos bond in the 10.3 billion dlr legal dispute with Pennzoil Co PZL to one billion dlrs. Yesterday, a Texas court granted a temporary injunction on the bond issue pending a hearing next week. The current litigation arose from Texacos buyout of Getty Oil Co in 1984. Pennzoil sued, arguing its earlier agreement to buy Getty was binding. Two Texas state courts upheld Pennzoils position. Randol, noting that the stock has suffered a great deal in the two years since the litigation was filed, said we recognize the legal problems but think investors have overdone it. He said the stock is selling at 48 pct of its asset value, and we think it represents a good value at this level.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Getty_family	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Talitha_Getty	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Getty_H._Huffine	http://dbpedia.org/resource/John_Getty	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Jonathan_Klein_(Getty_Images)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Getty_Leadership_Institute_at_Claremont_Graduate_University	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Carrie_Eliza_Getty_Tomb	http://dbpedia.org/resource/John_Paul_Getty_III	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Andrew_Getty	http://dbpedia.org/resource/John_Paul_Getty_Jr.

Parana	619	625	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Paraná_(state)	Storage problems with Brazils record grain crop are likely to result in losses of about five mln tonnes, an Agriculture Ministry spokesman said. Ministry spokesman Leonardo Brito, speaking from Brasilia, told Reuters he believed that about five mln tonnes of this years estimated crop of 65 mln tonnes would be lost. He said part of this would be the normal loss inevitable in harvesting, but that most of it would stem from storage problems. Brazil has a storage capacity of 66 mln tonnes, theoretically sufficient for the crop. But Brito said that the storage capacity was badly distributed. The states of Sao Paulo, Parana and Rio Grande do Sul had between them 70 pct of the nations capacity, but were responsible for only 50 to 60 pct of production. The biggest problems are concentrated in the Centre-West growing regions, where rising production has outpaced storage capacity. Brito said the Centre-West, whose crops include soya and maize, had between 30 and 40 pct of the nations grains production but only 20 pct of its storage space. In addition to the poor distribution of storage units, there is the problem that too much of the capacity is geared to storing grain in sacks, while not enough is suitable for storing loose grain, Brito said. Finally, there is a shortage of lorries to transport the crops. The sheer scale of the task in transporting the record crop has been evident from television reports, which have shown enormous queues of lorries waiting outside granaries.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Postplatyptilia_parana	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Parana_river_stingray	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Parana_Open	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Paranas,_Samar	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dihammaphora_parana	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Acanthogonatus_parana	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Acraga_parana	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Parana,_Punjab
Francis Tombs	915	928	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Francis_Tombs,_Baron_Tombs	Demand for shares in state-owned engine maker Rolls Royce Plc is expected to be substantial when the government privatises it at the end of April, Christopher Clark of the groups bankers Samuel Montagu and Sons Ltd said. He told a press conference after the release of an initial prospectus for the float that the issue would be offered to U.K. Institutions, company employees and the general public. As in previous flotations, clawback arrangements would be made if public subscriptions exceeded initial allocations. He declined to say how the shares would be allocated beyond saying that a significant proportion would go to institutions. A decision on what percentage would go to each sector would be made shortly before the sale price was announced on April 28. Minimum subscription would be for 400 shares with payment in two tranches, again a method broadly in line with previous privatisations. Chairman Sir Francis Tombs denied suggestions that Rolls was a stock that should be left to the institutions. He noted that although the aircraft industry was cyclical, Rolls had several operations -- such as spare parts and military equipment -- that evened out the swings. Rolls 1986 research and development expenditure in 1986 was 255 mln stg and could be expected in the future to vary according to changes in turnover. He noted that net research and development expenditure was written off in the year it occurred, a policy that received inadequate recognition in one or two of the more extravagant forecasts of future profits. He made no forecast himself. In 1986, Rolls reported that pretax profit rose 48 pct to 120 mln stg on turnover 12 pct higher at 1.8 billion.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/List_of_people_beatified_by_Pope_Francis	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sealing_the_Tomb	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Francis_Bevan	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Francis_Simard	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Francis_Cecil_Lopdell	http://dbpedia.org/resource/John_Francis_Mahoney	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Francis_Wurtz	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Francis_X._Schilling	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Francis_Hixson	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Francis_Grant,_Lord_Cullen
Budget committee	408	424	http://dbpedia.org/resource/United_States_House_Committee_on_the_Budget	Office of Management and Budget Director James Miller said President Reagan will reject the tax increase called for in the House Budget Committees 1988 budget proposal which is before the House for a vote today. Its just completely unacceptable, Miller told a House Appropriations subcommittee on Treasury, Postal Service and General Government Appropriations. The plan, drafted by the Democratic-controlled Budget committee, calls for 22 billion dlrs in higher revenues, of which 18 billion would be from new taxes set by the tax-writing committees. The House committees budget proposal includes some increases in federal user fees as well as 18 billion dlrs in taxes. Miller warned that failure to reduce the federal deficit would jeopardize the U.S. economy. If we do not further reduce the deficit... we place this economic expansion that weve had in the last five years at risk, Miller told the subcommittee. The result of any kind of tax increase would be to increase substantially the prospects that the expansion would come to an end, Miller said.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/2016_Canadian_federal_budget	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Budget_Responsibility_and_National_Audit_Act_2011	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Parker_Morris_Committee	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Committee_for_Privileges_and_Conduct	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Halifax_Joint_Committee	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Qatar_Olympic_Committee	http://dbpedia.org/resource/District_planning_committees_in_India	http://dbpedia.org/resource/European_Committee_(Parliament_of_Norway)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Permanent_Committees_of_the_Pan-African_Parliament	http://dbpedia.org/resource/National_Paralympic_Committee_Germany

Dominion	772	780	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dominion_Textile	The largest U.S. textile maker focused on its own business as its competitors found merger partners, but now Burlington Industries Inc may have restructured itself into an attractive takeover candidate, analysts said. The takeover spotlight fell today on Burlington, which rose 4-7/8 to 52-7/8 on speculation that investor Asher Edelman and Dominion Textiles Inc of Canada bought an almost five pct stake. A published report said Edelman and Dominion jointly acquired a stake in Burlington and were weighing a takeover offer. Edelman would not comment, and a spokesman for Montreal-based Dominion called the report just rumors. Burlington said it did not know if the report was true. Wall Street professionals said they were not convinced of the story or that Edelman and Dominion would be the victors if Burlington actually came into play. Arbitragers said past comments from Dominion, however, added credence to the speculation. Dominion has said that it was looking for a takeover in the U.S. Last year, Dominion unsuccessfully bid for Avondale Mills and has maintained a 120 mln dlr line of credit to be used for a U.S. acquisition. A Dominion spokesman said Canadas largest textile producer has been negotiating with many U.S. textile companies, but would not say whether Burlington was among them. There have been acquisitions in this area. Its not unusual that someone could be looking at Burlington after the housecleaning theyve done, said Eileen Gormley of Thomson McKinnon. Burlington sold its domestic operations, which made sheets and other linens, to J.P. Stevens and Co Inc for 110 mln dlrs last year. It also has reorganized management, and focused its operations on businesses that would be less affected by foreign competition, Gormley said. Theyve pulled back so as not to be a commodity marketer, said Gormley. She said in moving more heavily into industrial fabrics, Burlington bought C.H. Masland, which supplies carpets and other fabric to the auto industry. In the past, they just spent and never realized the return on the outlays they did make, she said. You look at their record over the year, and I think theyre poised to be more profitable than they had been in the past, Gormley said. She estimated 1987 earnings of 2.50 dlrs per share, up from 2.01 dlrs per share. Some analysts today recommended clients not buy Burlington at its current levels. Edward Johnson of Johnson Redbook said he recommends selling. He said he believes the stock is worth only about 50 dlrs on a takeover basis and about 46 dlrs on an earnings basis. Some arbitragers, however, said takeover values have been placed on the company of 60 to 65 dlrs per share. After Ashers (Edelman) recent history, a lot of people dont find him very credible anymore, said one arbitrager. Another, however, said Edelman succeeds in forcing managements to take steps to enhance shareholder values even if he doesnt win the target company. Edelman was unsuccessful last year in offers for Lucky Stores Inc and Fruehauf Corp. He did succeed in buying Ponderosa Inc. The stocks of other textile makers rose along with Burlington. J.P. Stevens STN climbed 5/8 to 44-7/8, and Fieldcrest Cannon Inc FLD, the result of a merger of Fieldcrest and Cannon, rose 1-1/8 to 39-3/4. West Point-Pepperell Inc WPM rose 1-7/8 to 67-1/8.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dominion_(Rock_band)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Avalanche_(Kings_Dominion)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Old_Dominion_Monarchs_baseball,_2010–19	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dominion_Theology	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dominion_of_Men	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dominion_Lands_Act	http://dbpedia.org/resource/All_Saints_Anglican_Church_(Dominion_City,_Manitoba)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dominion_6.18	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Inter_Dominion	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Immortal_Dominion

Brazil	1529	1535	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Brazil	Major cocoa exporters are likely to limit sales in the weeks ahead in an effort to boost world prices, sources close to a meeting of the Cocoa Producers Alliance (CPA) said. The sources said the depressed world market had been one of the main topics discussed in a closed door meeting of the 11-member CPA which began on Monday. They said producers agreed that cutting sales would aid the buffer stock manager of a new international cocoa pact in his effort to support prices. Major cocoa producing and consuming nations agreed operation rules for the buffer stock at a meeting in London last month and the stock manager is expected to enter the market soon. Prices, under the weight of three successive cocoa surpluses, recently fell to the level at which the manager has to buy cocoa under stock rules. The buffer stock aims to keep prices within a pre-set range by buying when prices fall and selling when they rise. The worlds cocoa price at present is just not interesting, commented one delegate representing a major CPA producer. Another source said that with much of the 1986/87 (October-September) world cocoa crop sold, limiting sales in the near term concerns essentially next years harvest. The sources noted, however, that the cocoa industry in Brazil, the worlds number two producer, is in private hands.

Colorado Public Utilities Commission	551	587	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Colorado_Public_Utilities_Commission	Public Service Co of Colorado said it has reached a preliminary agreement to resolve a territorial dispute with Union Rural Electric Association of Brighton, Colo. The company said, . The company said, "The tentative agreement protects UnionUnion's boundaries and also would set in motion a vote of UnionUnion's membership, which could lead to acquisition of Union by Public Service Co.." Union provides electrical service to about 14,000 members in cities and rural areas north of Denver. The company said the settlement, which is pending before the Colorado Public Utilities Commission, is under review by the Tri-State Generation and Transmission Association, which supplies power to Union, and is subject to approval by the Public Service Colorado board and UnionUnion's membership. It also will be discussed with the Colorado Rural Electric Association. It said legislation that would halt the acquisition of electric utility service territories by annexation will remain active in the Colorado House of Representatives until Union and Public Service assure legislators they are in agreement.

National Cancer Institute	2108	2133	http://dbpedia.org/resource/National_Cancer_Institute	Promising new findings in the use of a controversial experimental drug called Interleukin-2 as a cure for cancer will be published in the April 9 issue of the prestigious New England Journal of Medicine, according to a Wall Street analyst who has obtained an advance copy of the magazine. Among interleukins principal U. S. makers are Cetus Corp CTUS, headquartered in Emeryville, Calif., and Immunex Corp IMNX, based in Seattle, Wash. The journal, to be released late today, contains two articles reporting high remission rates several cancer types. The journal also contains a signed editorial concluding that the new results mark a significant milestone in the search for a successful immunotherapy for cancer. Interleukin-2, also known as IL-2, is a substance naturally produced by living cells in the laboratory. The drug is controversial because it was widely praised as a promising cancer treatment in early reports on its effectiveness in late 1985, only to come under criticism a year later for its failure to live up to its promise and due to its ravaging side effects. One of the new studies, conducted by Dr. William West of Biotherapeutics Inc of Franklin, Tenn., is particularly significant because it found far fewer harsh side effects after it changed the way in which the drug is administered. In that study, researchers administered IL-2 to 48 cancer patients and found a 50-pct remission rate for kidney cancers and a 50 pct remission rate for melanoma, a type of skin cancer, according to Prudential-Bache Securities Stuart Weisbrod, who obtained the advance copy of the magazine. For rectal and colon cancer, the researchers found no remissions, but none of the 48 patients treated had side effects serious enough to be placed under intensive hospital care, according to the article. In the second study, whose principal author is Dr. Steven Rosenberg of the National Cancer Institute, researchers administered IL-2 to 157 cancer patients and found a 33 pct remission rate in cancers of the kidney, a 27 pct rate in melanomas and a 15 pct rate in cancers of the colon and rectum. In the National Cancer Institute trials, a total of four patients died, the magazine reported, confirming the harshness of the drugs side effects as originally administered. Perhaps we are at the end of the beginning of the search for successful immunotherapy for cancer, said the editorial, signed by John Durant of Philadelphias Chase Cancer Center. These observations reported by Rosenberg and West surely did not describe successful practical approaches ready for widespread applications in the therapy of cancer patients, the editorial said. On the other hand, if they reflect, as seems possible, a successful manipulation of the cellular immune system, then we may be near the end of our search for a meaningful direction in the immunuotherapy of cancer, the editorial concluded.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/1923–24_Luxembourg_National_Division	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Republic_of_Korea_National_Red_Cross	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Institute_of_Historical_Research	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Armenia_national_football_team_results	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Philippines_national_rugby_league_team	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Guatemala_National_Police_Archives	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Queensland_National_Bank,_Forest_Hill	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Malaysia_women's_national_field_hockey_team	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Arayat_Institute	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Beatson_West_of_Scotland_Cancer_Centre

VW	257	259	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Volkswagen_Group	Volkswagen AG VOWG.F, VW, is due to make a formal announcement about its 1986 dividend tomorrow after saying the 1985 level of 10 marks per ordinary share would be held, despite massive losses because of a suspected foreign currency fraud. A spokesman said VWs supervisory board will meet tomorrow to discuss the payout. A statement will be made afterwards. VW has also said disclosed profits for 1986 will reach their 1985 level, despite provisions of a possible 480 mln marks linked to the currency affair. The figure is virtually the same as the 477 mln mark 1985 parent company net profit. When VW first confirmed the currency scandal on March 10 it said the management board would propose an unchanged 10-mark dividend to the supervisory board. A dividend of 11 marks would be proposed for the companys new preference shares. Share analysts said they saw supervisory board approval of the management board proposal as virtually a formality. Anything else would be more than a surprise, one said. Company sources said VW would have to dig into reserves to maintain the disclosed profit. Parent company reserves stood at around three billion marks at end-1985.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/VW_Hydri	http://dbpedia.org/resource/VW_Cephei	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cal-Style_VW	http://dbpedia.org/resource/VW_276_Schlepperfahrzeug	http://dbpedia.org/resource/VW_Electronics_Research_Laboratory	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Better_Half_VW	http://dbpedia.org/resource/VW_Herald
U.S. National Transportation Safety Board	541	582	http://dbpedia.org/resource/National_Transportation_Safety_Board	Faulty repair work by The Boeing Company BA.N was a contributary cause to a Japan Air Lines Co Ltd JAPN.Y 747 crash on August 12, 1985, that killed 520 people, the final draft of a Ministry of Transport report says. There were only four survivors when the aircraft crashed into a mountain north of Tokyo. The report said inadequate inspection of the aircraft by Japanese inspectors after the repairs was another factor in the crash. The crew were cleared of any responsibility for the disaster. The report, which was sent on March 23 to the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board for comment, should be released in late May. Under an international convention the draft must be submitted for final comments to the relevant authorities. Boeing spokesmen were unavailable for comment. On April 4, a Boeing spokesman at the firms headquarters said the company would probably make no comment on the Japanese investigation teams report until it was officially released. On September 6, 1985, Boeing said in a statement that the 1978 repairs it had undertaken were faulty. This statement did not, however, connect the faulty repairs with the cause of the crash.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Old_Canadian_National_rail_yard	http://dbpedia.org/resource/National_Center_for_Midwest_Art_and_Design	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Japan_National_Route_189	http://dbpedia.org/resource/National_Highway_1A_(India,_old_numbering)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Australian_Maritime_Safety_Authority	http://dbpedia.org/resource/List_of_number-one_adult_contemporary_singles_of_2015_(U.S.)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/USASA_National_Women's_Open	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Commander-in-Chief_National_Historic_Park	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Vanoise_National_Park	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Lake_Superior_National_Estuarine_Research_Reserve
Kenneth Kaunda	379	393	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Kenneth_Kaunda	The Zambian government has no immediate plans to follow last weeks increase in the producer price of maize with a hike in the retail price of maize meal, an official of the ruling party said. Last December, a 120 pct increase in the consumer price for refined maize meal, a Zambian staple, led to food riots in which at least 15 people died. That price increase, which President Kenneth Kaunda later revoked, followed pressure by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to reduce the governments subsidy bill. However, if the producer price rise, from 6.10 dlrs to 8.67 dlrs per 90-kg bag, is not accompanied by a retail price increase, the government will have to spend more on subsidies, a practice discouraged by the IMF. There is no way out but to raise the subsidy levels of meal. It (the government) would have to choose between the demands of the IMF and those of the people, a Ministry of Agriculture economist said.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Kenneth_and_Sarah_Ramsey	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Kenneth_Kapstad	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Kenneth_I._Gross	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Kenneth_Gangnes	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Kenneth_Uttley	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Kenneth_Sokoloff	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Kenneth_Peppiatt	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Kenneth_Marshall	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Kenneth_Michael_Kays	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Kenneth_Setton
Quebec	129	135	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Quebec	Quebec mines minister Raymond Savoie said the province is prepared to offer money to help re-open (Noranda Inc))'s Murdochville, Quebec copper mine, shut down by fire last week, but said he could not give a specific figure until damage estimates have been completed. Federal member of parliament for the region,  Charles-Eugene Marin, said last week the federal government is also prepared to provide financial help to restart operations as soon as possible. Noranda has estimated damage from the fire at about 10 mln dlrs and a company spokesman said it should have a more specific estimate by the end of the month. Noranda said it had hoped to have an estimate sooner, but has found that it will take longer than expected to gain access to the burned-out area. Noranda said the mine was not insured.  said the mine was not insured.

Netherlands	164	175	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Netherlands	Roughly half of this years expected 130,000 hectare Dutch sugar beet crop is already in the ground, a spokesman for Suiker Unie, the largest sugar processor in the Netherlands, told Reuters. Conditions are generally good and the average sowing date for the crop is expected to be around April 11, against April 23 last year, and a 10-year average of April 14, the spokesman added. It is far too early yet to say what kind of output we can expect when it comes to harvest in September, but at least the crop is off to a very good start, he said. Last year, the Netherlands planted a record 137,600 hectares of sugar beet and produced a record 1.2 mln tonnes of white sugar, substantially more than the countrys combined A and B quota of 872,000 tonnes. This year, however, a self-imposed quota system has been introduced with the aim of cutting plantings to 130,000 hectares and reducing white sugar output to around 915,000 tonnes to minimise the amount of non-quota C sugar produced. Only farmers with a record of growing suger beet have been allotted quotas. This is expected to prevent the area being boosted by dairy or cereal farmers moving into sugar.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/National_Alliance_(Netherlands)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/1785_in_the_Netherlands	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Same-sex_marriage_in_the_Netherlands	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Fox_(Netherlands)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Prix_de_Rome_(Netherlands)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Governor_of_the_Netherlands_Antilles	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Netherlands_Organisation_for_Scientific_Research	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mali-Netherlands_relations	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Speaker_of_the_House_of_Representatives_(Netherlands)_election,_2016	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Football_in_the_Netherlands_Antilles

Paris Club	891	901	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Paris_Club	Plans to rejuvenate Polands economy by reducing central government control would help reassure Western creditors that the countrys economy was safe to invest in, a senior Polish official said. The business of granting loans to Poland is not as bad a business as you might imagine, senior Polish government spokesman Jerzy Urban told a news conference in Stockholm. Urban, visiting the Swedish capital to deliver a lecture at the Foreign Policy Institute, announced earlier this week that Poland would soon offer shares to private citizens in state companies in a bid to make the economy more responsive. This was part of a major economic reform to be announced in the coming weeks, he said. Urban said the main problem with his countrys foreign debt burden of 32 billion dollars was short term interest charges but the long term looked more secure. He said he hoped talks under way with the Paris Club, grouping Polands main government creditors, would shortly solve the problem of short term servicing. Urban told reporters that debt servicing was hampering the expansion of the national economy, but that the new plans for economic reform would open new vistas for Polish exports. He criticised the blocking efforts of some Western governments, whom he declined to name, for putting political considerations ahead of economic co-operation. After the lifting of U.S. Sanctions against the Polish economy we considered all political obstacles had been removed, but that has not been the case, Urban said.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Lycée_Victor_Hugo,_Paris	http://dbpedia.org/resource/List_of_Scottish_Premier_League_clubs	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Marylebone_Cricket_Club_tours_of_Ceylon_and_Sri_Lanka	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Lancaster_Football_Club	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Saint-Denis_–_Porte_de_Paris_(Paris_Métro)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/First_and_Third_Trinity_Boat_Club	http://dbpedia.org/resource/South_Barwon_Football_Club	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Club_deal	http://dbpedia.org/resource/List_of_English_and_Welsh_cricket_league_clubs	http://dbpedia.org/resource/CSK_VVS_Samara_(women's_football_club)

The Department of Trade and Industry said earlier it had concluded a memorandum of understanding with Japans Finance Ministry to swap supervisory and investigatory information. The agreement covers stocks, shares and government bonds, but not commodity futures, whose regulation in Japan does not come under the Finance Ministry. It therefore does not cover some transactions on the London International Financial Futures Exchange and the London commodities and metal exchanges. The DTI said it hoped to seek further understandings with other countries which met in the U.K. Last December. The meeting involved delegates from the U.K., Switzerland, the U.S., Canada, Australia, Hong Kong, Japan, France, West Germany and Holland. Government sources said the deal with Japan completes arrangements linking Tokyo, the U.S. And London. A U.K. Agreement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) was signed last September. Todays agreement will deal with requests for information on a case by case basis, U.K. Government sources said.

Its just completely unacceptable, Miller told a House Appropriations subcommittee on Treasury, Postal Service and General Government Appropriations. The plan, drafted by the Democratic-controlled Budget committee, calls for 22 billion dlrs in higher revenues, of which 18 billion would be from new taxes set by the tax-writing committees. The House committees budget proposal includes some increases in federal user fees as well as 18 billion dlrs in taxes. Miller warned that failure to reduce the federal deficit would jeopardize the U.S. economy. If we do not further reduce the deficit... we place this economic expansion that weve had in the last five years at risk, Miller told the subcommittee.

Japans Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI),	228	287	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ministry_of_International_Trade_and_Industry	Senior Japanese officials tomorrow open talks with American trade negotiators in a last-ditch effort to avert new high U.S. tariffs to be imposed on a wide variety of Japanese electronic exports. Makoto Kuroda, vice minister of Japans Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI), is to hold two days of meetings with the Deputy U.S. Trade Representative, Michael Smith, and the Under Secretary of Commerce, Bruce Smart. The new tariffs, to go into effect on April 17, are in retaliation for Japans failure to adhere to an agreement to end dumping semiconductors in world markets at below cost and to open its home market to U.S. semiconductor shipments. They are to be imposed on goods which use semiconductors, including television and audio equipment and computers. Both U.S. and Japanese officials have said there was little likelihood the talks would do anything to avert the 100 pct duties on 300 mln dlrs worth of Japanese shipments. President Reagan announced the planned tariffs on March 27 after he said that close monitoring of the July 1986 U.S.-Japanese semiconductor pact convinced U.S. officials that Japan was not honoring the agreement. In making the annoucement, Reagan said I am committed to the full enforcement of our trade agreements designed to provide American industry with free and fair trade. Trade analysts said his move was aimed as much at Japans semiconductor trade practices, which are said to have injured the U.S. semiconductor industry, as Congress, which has complained about presidential timidity on trade issues. Congressional Democrats have pledged to enact aggressive trade laws to counter what they contend has been Reagans inaction to redress the growing U.S. trade deficit, which last year reached 169.8 billion dlrs. About one-third of the deficit was with Japan. Reagan said there were recent signs Japan was beginning to adhere to the pact and that was why he was not terminating it. Kuroda said on leaving Tokyo today he had no new proposals but did have an explanation of the semiconductor situation. He told the daily newspaper Ashai Shimbun that Reagans decision was based on inaccurate data and an exaggerated sense of MITIs power to control Japanese traders. The United States has excessive expectations., he said. To stabilize supply-demand relations which have been disrupted by excess inventories since 1985 will take some time. He also said that U.S. firms had not been aggressive enough in trying to sell in the Japanese market.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Marine_and_Fisheries_Agency	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Town_and_Country_Planning_(Use_Classes)_Order_1987	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Portrait_of_Abraham_de_Potter	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Lee_and_Gottliebe_Fritz_House	http://dbpedia.org/resource/2015_Syed_Modi_International_Grand_Prix_Gold	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Emperor_and_Galilean	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bucharest_student_movement_of_1956	http://dbpedia.org/resource/2011_Tōhoku_earthquake_and_tsunami	http://dbpedia.org/resource/The_Physics_of_Blown_Sand_and_Desert_Dunes	http://dbpedia.org/resource/List_of_ship_commissionings_in_1918

GAF Corp	375	383	http://dbpedia.org/resource/GAF_Materials_Corporation	Cheap oil feedstocks, the weakened U.S. dollar and a plant utilization rate approaching 90 pct will propel the streamlined U.S. petrochemical industry to record profits this year, with growth expected through at least 1990, major company executives predicted. This bullish outlook for chemical manufacturing and an industrywide move to shed unrelated businesses has prompted GAF Corp (GAF), privately-held Cain Chemical Inc, and other firms to aggressively seek acquisitions of petrochemical plants. Oil companies such as Ashland Oil Inc (ASH), the Kentucky-based oil refiner and marketer, are also shopping for money-making petrochemical businesses to buy. I see us poised at the threshold of a golden period, said Paul Oreffice, chairman of giant Dow Chemical Co (DOW), adding, Theres no major plant capacity being added around the world now. The whole game is bringing out new products and improving the old ones. Analysts say the chemical industrys biggest customers, automobile manufacturers and home builders that use a lot of paints and plastics, are expected to buy quantities this year. U.S. petrochemical plants are currently operating at about 90 pct capacity, reflecting tighter supply that could hike product prices by 30 to 40 pct this year, said John Dosher, managing director of Pace Consultants Inc of Houston. Demand for some products such as styrene could push profit margins up by as much as 300 pct, he said. Oreffice, speaking at a meeting of chemical engineers in Houston, said Dow would easily top the 741 mln dlrs it earned last year and predicted it would have the best year in its history. In 1985, when oil prices were still above 25 dlrs a barrel and chemical exports were adversely affected by the strong U.S. dollar, Dow had profits of 58 mln dlrs. I believe the entire chemical industry is headed for a record year or close to it, Oreffice said. GAF chairman Samuel Heyman estimated that the U.S. chemical industry would report a 20 pct gain in profits during 1987. Last year, the domestic industry earned a total of 13 billion dlrs, a 54 pct leap from 1985. The turn in the fortunes of the once-sickly chemical industry has been brought about by a combination of luck and planning, said Paces John Dosher. Dosher said last years fall in oil prices made feedstocks dramatically cheaper and at the same time the American dollar was weakening against foreign currencies. That helped boost U.S. chemical exports. Also helping to bring supply and demand into balance has been the gradual market absorption of the extra chemical manufacturing capacity created by Middle Eastern oil producers in the early 1980s. Finally, virtually all major U.S. chemical manufacturers have embarked on an extensive corporate restructuring program to mothball inefficient plants, trim the payroll and eliminate unrelated businesses. The restructuring touched off a flurry of friendly and hostile takeover attempts. GAF, which made an unsuccessful attempt in 1985 to acquire Union Carbide Corp UK, recently offered three billion dlrs for Borg Warner Corp BOR, a Chicago manufacturer of plastics and chemicals. Another industry powerhouse, W.R. Grace (GRA) has divested its retailing, restaurant and fertilizer businesses to raise cash for chemical acquisitions. But some experts worry that the chemical industry may be headed for trouble if companies continue turning their back on the manufacturing of staple petrochemical commodities, such as ethylene, in favor of more profitable specialty chemicals that are custom-designed for a small group of buyers. Companies like DuPont (DD) and Monsanto Co MTC spent the past two or three years trying to get out of the commodity chemical business in reaction to how badly the market had deteriorated, Dosher said. But I think they will eventually kill the margins on the profitable chemicals in the niche market. Some top chemical executives share the concern. The challenge for our industry is to keep from getting carried away and repeating past mistakes, GAFs Heyman cautioned. The shift from commodity chemicals may be ill-advised. Specialty businesses do not stay special long. Houston-based Cain Chemical, created this month by the Sterling investment banking group, believes it can generate 700 mln dlrs in annual sales by bucking the industry trend. Chairman Gordon Cain, who previously led a leveraged buyout of Duponts Conoco Incs chemical business, has spent 1.1 billion dlrs since January to buy seven petrochemical plants along the Texas Gulf Coast. The plants produce only basic commodity petrochemicals that are the building blocks of specialty products. This kind of commodity chemical business will never be a glamorous, high-margin business, Cain said, adding that demand is expected to grow by about three pct annually. Garo Armen, an analyst with Dean Witter Reynolds, said chemical makers have also benefitted by increasing demand for plastics as prices become more competitive with aluminum, wood and steel products. Armen estimated the upturn in the chemical business could last as long as four or five years, provided the U.S. economy continues its modest rate of growth.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sri_Lanka_Army_Service_Corps	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Imperial_Camel_Corps	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Intelligence_Corps	http://dbpedia.org/resource/5th_Mechanised_Corps_(Soviet_Union)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/IV_Corps_(United_Kingdom)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ajaxo_Inc._v._E*Trade_Financial_Corp.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/XVII_Corps_(Union_Army)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Corps_of_Engineers	http://dbpedia.org/resource/2nd_Corps_(Vietnam_People's_Army)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Robertson_v_Thomson_Corp
Japan	447	452	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Japan	Britain intends to negotiate further agreements on international securities regulation to match those now in force with the U.S. And Japan, government sources said. The Department of Trade and Industry said earlier it had concluded a memorandum of understanding with Japans Finance Ministry to swap supervisory and investigatory information. The agreement covers stocks, shares and government bonds, but not commodity futures, whose regulation in Japan does not come under the Finance Ministry. It therefore does not cover some transactions on the London International Financial Futures Exchange and the London commodities and metal exchanges. The DTI said it hoped to seek further understandings with other countries which met in the U.K. Last December. The meeting involved delegates from the U.K., Switzerland, the U.S., Canada, Australia, Hong Kong, Japan, France, West Germany and Holland. Government sources said the deal with Japan completes arrangements linking Tokyo, the U.S. And London. A U.K. Agreement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) was signed last September. Todays agreement will deal with requests for information on a case by case basis, U.K. Government sources said. It is not legally binding and comes into force immediately.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Citizen_and_consumer_movements_in_Japan	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Live_in_Japan_(Fred_Frith_album)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/2004_MTV_Video_Music_Awards_Japan	http://dbpedia.org/resource/2014_China–Japan–Korea_Friendship_Athletic_Meeting	http://dbpedia.org/resource/1991–92_Japan_Soccer_League	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Japan-India_Association	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Japan_National_Route_125	http://dbpedia.org/resource/University_of_Occupational_and_Environmental_Health_Japan	http://dbpedia.org/resource/14th_Japan_Record_Awards	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Japan_Teachers_Union

Georgia Power Co	233	249	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Georgia_Power	An audit submitted to the Georgia Public Service Commission claims that between 944 mln dlrs and 1.8 billion dlrs of the costs of the Plant Vogtle nuclear power station should be disallowed, a Southern Co spokeswoman said. Southerns Georgia Power Co subsidiary has a 45.7 pct interest in the plant and estimated earlier this year it would cost a total of 8.87 billion dlrs. Last year, the plants owners pledged to Georgia regulators they would limit the cost passed on to rate payers to 8.4 billion dlrs. The Southern spokeswoman said the company feels the report by OBrien-Kreitzberg is flawed and biased. She said the report was released yesterday by the state attorney general. Responding to the report today, Georgia Power Chairman Robert W. Scherer told a news conference the conclusions drawn by the firm are not only wrong -- they also reflect the same bias against nuclear power that these auditors have demonstrated in similar cases accross the country. Saying he was not suggesting Georgia power was without fault, Scherer said the audit identified several things I wish we had done differently. Scherer pointed out a report OBrien-Kreitzberg submitted to Georgia regulators in March 1986 projected Georgia Power would not finish Plant Vogtle unit one before the end of 1987. Noting unit one is finished, and we expect it to be in commercial operationg by June, he said the firms latest report ignored the earlier projection, gave the utility no credit for the completion and actually penalized us by suggesting that costs to maintain t he schedule be disallowed. Scherer said the latest audit alleges Georgia Power could have saved 95 mln dlrs if it had stopped using four shifts, seven days a week to speed construction three years sooner. He said this would have delayed completion of the plant for another year and it would have cost several hunderd million dlrs more. Noting the audit said costs were increased 600 mln dlrs by schedule delays totaling 20.5 months, he said First, we have the best concrete placement record in the industry, Second new government regulations after the Three Mile Island incident significantly increased construction time.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Heritage_High_School_(Conyers,_Georgia)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Marl-Chemiepark_Power_Station	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mungarra_Power_Station	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Absolute_Power_(Pro-Pain_album)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/List_of_Georgia_State_University_people	http://dbpedia.org/resource/McIntosh_County,_Georgia	http://dbpedia.org/resource/147th_Georgia_General_Assembly	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Oakwood,_Georgia	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Universal_power	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Power_and_Love

VW	358	360	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Volkswagen_Group	Volkswagen AG VOWG.F, VW, is due to make a formal announcement about its 1986 dividend tomorrow after saying the 1985 level of 10 marks per ordinary share would be held, despite massive losses because of a suspected foreign currency fraud. A spokesman said VWs supervisory board will meet tomorrow to discuss the payout. A statement will be made afterwards. VW has also said disclosed profits for 1986 will reach their 1985 level, despite provisions of a possible 480 mln marks linked to the currency affair. The figure is virtually the same as the 477 mln mark 1985 parent company net profit. When VW first confirmed the currency scandal on March 10 it said the management board would propose an unchanged 10-mark dividend to the supervisory board. A dividend of 11 marks would be proposed for the companys new preference shares. Share analysts said they saw supervisory board approval of the management board proposal as virtually a formality. Anything else would be more than a surprise, one said. Company sources said VW would have to dig into reserves to maintain the disclosed profit. Parent company reserves stood at around three billion marks at end-1985.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/VW_Electronics_Research_Laboratory	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Better_Half_VW	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cal-Style_VW	http://dbpedia.org/resource/VW_Cephei	http://dbpedia.org/resource/VW_276_Schlepperfahrzeug	http://dbpedia.org/resource/VW_Hydri	http://dbpedia.org/resource/VW_Herald

Prudential-Bache Securities	1509	1536	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Prudential_Securities	Promising new findings in the use of a controversial experimental drug called Interleukin-2 as a cure for cancer will be published in the April 9 issue of the prestigious New England Journal of Medicine, according to a Wall Street analyst who has obtained an advance copy of the magazine. Among interleukins principal U. S. makers are Cetus Corp CTUS, headquartered in Emeryville, Calif., and Immunex Corp IMNX, based in Seattle, Wash. The journal, to be released late today, contains two articles reporting high remission rates several cancer types. The journal also contains a signed editorial concluding that the new results mark a significant milestone in the search for a successful immunotherapy for cancer. Interleukin-2, also known as IL-2, is a substance naturally produced by living cells in the laboratory. The drug is controversial because it was widely praised as a promising cancer treatment in early reports on its effectiveness in late 1985, only to come under criticism a year later for its failure to live up to its promise and due to its ravaging side effects. One of the new studies, conducted by Dr. William West of Biotherapeutics Inc of Franklin, Tenn., is particularly significant because it found far fewer harsh side effects after it changed the way in which the drug is administered. In that study, researchers administered IL-2 to 48 cancer patients and found a 50-pct remission rate for kidney cancers and a 50 pct remission rate for melanoma, a type of skin cancer, according to Prudential-Bache Securities Stuart Weisbrod, who obtained the advance copy of the magazine. For rectal and colon cancer, the researchers found no remissions, but none of the 48 patients treated had side effects serious enough to be placed under intensive hospital care, according to the article. In the second study, whose principal author is Dr. Steven Rosenberg of the National Cancer Institute, researchers administered IL-2 to 157 cancer patients and found a 33 pct remission rate in cancers of the kidney, a 27 pct rate in melanomas and a 15 pct rate in cancers of the colon and rectum. In the National Cancer Institute trials, a total of four patients died, the magazine reported, confirming the harshness of the drugs side effects as originally administered. Perhaps we are at the end of the beginning of the search for successful immunotherapy for cancer, said the editorial, signed by John Durant of Philadelphias Chase Cancer Center. These observations reported by Rosenberg and West surely did not describe successful practical approaches ready for widespread applications in the therapy of cancer patients, the editorial said. On the other hand, if they reflect, as seems possible, a successful manipulation of the cellular immune system, then we may be near the end of our search for a meaningful direction in the immunuotherapy of cancer, the editorial concluded.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/United_Nations_Security_Council_Resolution_1282	http://dbpedia.org/resource/United_Nations_Security_Council_Resolution_118	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tana_High_Level_Forum_on_Security_in_Africa	http://dbpedia.org/resource/STET_Homeland_Security_Services	http://dbpedia.org/resource/European_Union_Agency_for_Network_and_Information_Security	http://dbpedia.org/resource/2013_French_White_Paper_on_Defence_and_National_Security	http://dbpedia.org/resource/United_Nations_Security_Council_Resolution_2034	http://dbpedia.org/resource/United_Nations_Security_Council_Resolution_381	http://dbpedia.org/resource/United_Nations_Security_Council_Resolution_1372	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Oklahoma_Homeland_Security_Act

Buenos Aires	1238	1250	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Buenos_Aires	Argentine grain producers adjusted their yield estimates for the 1986/87 coarse grain crop downward in the week to yesterday after the heavy rains at the end of March and beginning of April, trade sources said. They said sunflower, maize and sorghum production estimates had been reduced despite some later warm, dry weather, which has allowed a return to harvesting in some areas. However, as showers fell intermittently after last weekend, producers feared another spell of prolonged and intense rain could cause more damage to crops already badly hit this season. Rains in the middle of last week reached an average of 27 millimetres in parts of Buenos Aires province, 83 mm in Cordoba, 41 in Santa Fe, 50 in Entre Rios and Misiones, 95 in Corrientes, eight in Chaco and 35 in Formosa. There was no rainfall in the same period in La Pampa. Producers feared continued damp conditions could produce rotting and lead to still lower yield estimates for all the crops, including soybean. However, as the lands began drying later in the week harvesting advanced considerably, reaching between 36 and 40 pct of the area sown in the case of sunflower. Deterioration of the sunflower crop evident in harvested material in Cordoba, La Pampa and Buenos Aires forced yield estimates per hectare to be adjusted down again. The seasons sunflowerseed production is now forecast at 2.1 mln to 2.3 mln tonnes, against 2.2 mln to 2.4 mln forecast last week and down 43.9 to 48.8 pct on the 1985/86 record of 4.1 mln. Area sown to sunflowers was two to 2.2 mln hectares, 29.9 to 36.3 pct below the record 3.14 mln hectares last season. Maize harvesting has also reached 36 to 40 pct of the area sown. It is near completion in Cordoba and Santa Fe and will begin in La Pampa and southern Buenos Aires later in April. Production estimates for maize were down from last week at 9.5 mln to 9.8 mln tonnes, against 9.6 mln to 9.9 mln estimated previously. This is 22.2 to 23.4 pct below the 12.4 mln to 12.6 mln tonnes estimated by private sources for the 1985/86 crop and 21.9 to 25.8 pct down on the official figure of 12.8 mln tonnes. Maize was sown on 3.58 mln to 3.78 mln hectares, two to seven pct down on last seasons 3.85 mln. Sorghum was harvested on 23 to 25 pct of the area sown in Cordoba, Santa Fe and Chaco. Harvest will start in La Pampa and Buenos Aires in mid-April. The total area sown was 1.23 mln to 1.30 mln hectares, 10.3 to 15.2 pct down on the 1.45 mln sown last season. The new forecast for the sorghum crop is 2.9 mln to 3.2 mln tonnes compared with three mln to 3.3 mln forecast last week, and is 23.8 to 29.3 pct down on last seasons 4.1 mln to 4.2 mln tonne crop. The soybean crop for this season was not adjusted, remaining at a record 7.5 mln to 7.7 mln tonnes, up 4.2 to 5.5 pct on the 7.2 mln to 7.3 mln estimated by private sources for 1985/86 and 5.6 to 8.5 pct higher than the official figure of 7.1 mln. The area sown to soybeans this season was a record 3.7 mln to 3.8 mln hectares, 10.8 to 13.8 pct up on the record 3.34 mln sown in 1985/86. The soybean crop is showing excessive moisture in some areas and producers fear they may discover more damage. Some experimental harvesting was carried out in Santa Fe on areas making up only about one pct of the total crop but details on this were not available. Preparation of the fields for the 1987/88 wheat crop, which will be sown between May and August or September, has so far not been as intense as in previous years.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Buenos_Aires_Carnival	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tigre,_Buenos_Aires	http://dbpedia.org/resource/List_of_Buenos_Aires_Underground_stations	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Line_E_(Buenos_Aires_Underground)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Buenos_Aires_Rojo_Sangre	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Democratic_Party_of_the_City_of_Buenos_Aires	http://dbpedia.org/resource/ARA_Buenos_Aires_(1895)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Buenos_Aires-class_destroyer	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Martín_Coronado,_Buenos_Aires	http://dbpedia.org/resource/El_Cantor_de_Buenos_Aires

VW	599	601	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Volkswagen_Group	Volkswagen AG VOWG.F, VW, is due to make a formal announcement about its 1986 dividend tomorrow after saying the 1985 level of 10 marks per ordinary share would be held, despite massive losses because of a suspected foreign currency fraud. A spokesman said VWs supervisory board will meet tomorrow to discuss the payout. A statement will be made afterwards. VW has also said disclosed profits for 1986 will reach their 1985 level, despite provisions of a possible 480 mln marks linked to the currency affair. The figure is virtually the same as the 477 mln mark 1985 parent company net profit. When VW first confirmed the currency scandal on March 10 it said the management board would propose an unchanged 10-mark dividend to the supervisory board. A dividend of 11 marks would be proposed for the companys new preference shares. Share analysts said they saw supervisory board approval of the management board proposal as virtually a formality. Anything else would be more than a surprise, one said. Company sources said VW would have to dig into reserves to maintain the disclosed profit. Parent company reserves stood at around three billion marks at end-1985.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Better_Half_VW	http://dbpedia.org/resource/VW_Electronics_Research_Laboratory	http://dbpedia.org/resource/VW_Herald	http://dbpedia.org/resource/VW_Cephei	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cal-Style_VW	http://dbpedia.org/resource/VW_Hydri	http://dbpedia.org/resource/VW_276_Schlepperfahrzeug

IMF	463	466	http://dbpedia.org/resource/International_Monetary_Fund	The Zambian government has no immediate plans to follow last weeks increase in the producer price of maize with a hike in the retail price of maize meal, an official of the ruling party said. Last December, a 120 pct increase in the consumer price for refined maize meal, a Zambian staple, led to food riots in which at least 15 people died. That price increase, which President Kenneth Kaunda later revoked, followed pressure by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to reduce the governments subsidy bill. However, if the producer price rise, from 6.10 dlrs to 8.67 dlrs per 90-kg bag, is not accompanied by a retail price increase, the government will have to spend more on subsidies, a practice discouraged by the IMF. There is no way out but to raise the subsidy levels of meal. It (the government) would have to choose between the demands of the IMF and those of the people, a Ministry of Agriculture economist said.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/List_of_IMF_ranked_countries_by_GDP	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Romania-IMF_relations	http://dbpedia.org/resource/IMF_Economic_Review	http://dbpedia.org/resource/IMF_Balance_of_Payments_Manual	http://dbpedia.org/resource/1976_IMF_Crisis	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ukraine–IMF_relations	http://dbpedia.org/resource/List_of_IMF_Economic_Counsellors	http://dbpedia.org/resource/IMF_(file_format)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/IMF_Stand-By_Arrangement
Brazil	2185	2191	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Brazil	J.P. Morgan and Co Inc said its first-quarter earnings fell by 3.2 pct, largely reflecting its previously announced decision to place on non-accrual status its 1.3 billion dlrs of medium- and long-term loans to Brazil. That decision, spurred by Brazils suspension of interest payments on February 20, reduced the quarters net income by 20 mln dlrs to 226.4 mln dlrs, compared with 233.9 mln in the first three months of 1986. Morgan also reported a loss of 1.8 mln dlrs from securities underwriting and trading, in contrast to a gain of 45.4 mln dlrs in the year-earlier period. In the fourth quarter of 1986, Morgan posted other trading losses of 5.5 mln dlrs because of setbacks in the trading and underwriting of Euromarket securities. Conditions in some sectors of the Euromarket remained difficult last quarter, with floating rate notes suffering heavy price falls, but a spokeswoman was unable to say whether Morgans trading losses were restricted to the Euromarket. On the positive side, Morgan reduced its provision for loan losses to 35 mln dlrs from 70 mln a year earlier. Foreign exchange trading income rose to 82 mln dlrs from 72.6 mln and trust income increased to 95.9 mln dlrs from 75.9 mln. Morgan said other operating income, mainly fees and commissions, rose to 102.2 mln dlrs from 88.4 mln, but net investment securities gains dropped to 43.1 mln from 58.1 mln. Net interest earnings were 490.4 mln dlrs in the first quarter, down from 499.4 mln a year earlier, and net yield fell to 2.79 pct from 3.20 pct. If Brazil had not been placed on non-accrual, which means that interest can be recorded as income only when payments are actually received, net interest earnings would have been 525.9 mln dlrs and net yield 2.99 pct. If Brazil does not resume payments, 1987 net would be cut by 72 mln dlrs, Morgan added. After the provision for loan losses, Morgans allowance for credit losses at the end of March totaled 953 mln dlrs compared with 910 mln at end-1986 and 815 mln a year earlier. It reported net recoveries of six mln dlrs after charge-offs of eight mln, compared with net charge-offs of 49 mln dlrs after recoveries of three mln a year earlier. Excluding Brazil, non-accruing loans at quarters end were 583 mln dlrs, down from 633 mln at end-1986 and 684 mln a year earlier. Non-interest expenses rose to 371.1 mln dlrs from 303.5 mln dlrs, with more than half the increase related to personnel costs, Morgan said.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Coastline_of_Brazil	http://dbpedia.org/resource/2012–13_Brazil_network_television_schedule	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Coat_of_arms_of_the_Federal_District_(Brazil)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/List_of_mayors_of_Belo_Horizonte,_Brazil	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Brazil–New_Zealand_relations	http://dbpedia.org/resource/1911_in_Brazil	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Embassy_of_Brazil,_London	http://dbpedia.org/resource/José,_Prince_of_Brazil	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Environmental_protection_area_(Brazil)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Brazil–European_Union_relations

SEC	948	951	http://dbpedia.org/resource/U.S._Securities_and_Exchange_Commission	Securities and Exchange Commission John Shad said he wanted Congress to write a better definition of insider trading but thought action should wait until the Supreme Court ruled on an insider trading case. Id like the benefit of the Winans decision before deciding on a definition, Shad told a Senate Appropriations subcommittee hearing. Shad was refering to the appeal by former Wall Street Journal reporter R. Foster Winans of his conviction on insider trading charges for telling a friend in advance what stocks he was going to write about in his column. The stocks usually went up or down in price depending on Winans recommendation. He said insider trading accounted for only 11 percent of the SECs enforcement activities last year despite the publicity given to recent major cases. Insider trading makes up only a tiny fraction of one pct of the 50 billion dlrs of daily securities trading, Shad said. Shad asked for a budget increase so the SEC could enlarge its enforcement staff by 20 this year and 73 next year to deal with all types of securities fraud. Shad said he hoped to start his new duties as U.S. Ambassador to the Netherlands by June. He said he did not know when his successor would be named by President Reagan.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Boissy-le-Sec	http://dbpedia.org/resource/St._Theresa's_Convent_Sr._Sec._School	http://dbpedia.org/resource/1977_All-SEC_football_team	http://dbpedia.org/resource/2006_All-SEC_football_team	http://dbpedia.org/resource/1999_SEC_Men's_Basketball_Tournament	http://dbpedia.org/resource/1972_All-SEC_football_team	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pârâul_Sec_(Valea_Mare)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/1980_All-SEC_football_team	http://dbpedia.org/resource/SEC_v._Rajaratnam	http://dbpedia.org/resource/1985_SEC_Men's_Basketball_Tournament
J.P. Stevens	3116	3128	http://dbpedia.org/resource/WestPoint_Home	The largest U.S. textile maker focused on its own business as its competitors found merger partners, but now Burlington Industries Inc may have restructured itself into an attractive takeover candidate, analysts said. The takeover spotlight fell today on Burlington, which rose 4-7/8 to 52-7/8 on speculation that investor Asher Edelman and Dominion Textiles Inc of Canada bought an almost five pct stake. A published report said Edelman and Dominion jointly acquired a stake in Burlington and were weighing a takeover offer. Edelman would not comment, and a spokesman for Montreal-based Dominion called the report just rumors. Burlington said it did not know if the report was true. Wall Street professionals said they were not convinced of the story or that Edelman and Dominion would be the victors if Burlington actually came into play. Arbitragers said past comments from Dominion, however, added credence to the speculation. Dominion has said that it was looking for a takeover in the U.S. Last year, Dominion unsuccessfully bid for Avondale Mills and has maintained a 120 mln dlr line of credit to be used for a U.S. acquisition. A Dominion spokesman said Canadas largest textile producer has been negotiating with many U.S. textile companies, but would not say whether Burlington was among them. There have been acquisitions in this area. Its not unusual that someone could be looking at Burlington after the housecleaning theyve done, said Eileen Gormley of Thomson McKinnon. Burlington sold its domestic operations, which made sheets and other linens, to J.P. Stevens and Co Inc for 110 mln dlrs last year. It also has reorganized management, and focused its operations on businesses that would be less affected by foreign competition, Gormley said. Theyve pulled back so as not to be a commodity marketer, said Gormley. She said in moving more heavily into industrial fabrics, Burlington bought C.H. Masland, which supplies carpets and other fabric to the auto industry. In the past, they just spent and never realized the return on the outlays they did make, she said. You look at their record over the year, and I think theyre poised to be more profitable than they had been in the past, Gormley said. She estimated 1987 earnings of 2.50 dlrs per share, up from 2.01 dlrs per share. Some analysts today recommended clients not buy Burlington at its current levels. Edward Johnson of Johnson Redbook said he recommends selling. He said he believes the stock is worth only about 50 dlrs on a takeover basis and about 46 dlrs on an earnings basis. Some arbitragers, however, said takeover values have been placed on the company of 60 to 65 dlrs per share. After Ashers (Edelman) recent history, a lot of people dont find him very credible anymore, said one arbitrager. Another, however, said Edelman succeeds in forcing managements to take steps to enhance shareholder values even if he doesnt win the target company. Edelman was unsuccessful last year in offers for Lucky Stores Inc and Fruehauf Corp. He did succeed in buying Ponderosa Inc. The stocks of other textile makers rose along with Burlington. J.P. Stevens STN climbed 5/8 to 44-7/8, and Fieldcrest Cannon Inc FLD, the result of a merger of Fieldcrest and Cannon, rose 1-1/8 to 39-3/4.

GAF	385	388	http://dbpedia.org/resource/GAF_Materials_Corporation	Cheap oil feedstocks, the weakened U.S. dollar and a plant utilization rate approaching 90 pct will propel the streamlined U.S. petrochemical industry to record profits this year, with growth expected through at least 1990, major company executives predicted. This bullish outlook for chemical manufacturing and an industrywide move to shed unrelated businesses has prompted GAF Corp (GAF), privately-held Cain Chemical Inc, and other firms to aggressively seek acquisitions of petrochemical plants. Oil companies such as Ashland Oil Inc (ASH), the Kentucky-based oil refiner and marketer, are also shopping for money-making petrochemical businesses to buy. I see us poised at the threshold of a golden period, said Paul Oreffice, chairman of giant Dow Chemical Co (DOW), adding, Theres no major plant capacity being added around the world now. The whole game is bringing out new products and improving the old ones. Analysts say the chemical industrys biggest customers, automobile manufacturers and home builders that use a lot of paints and plastics, are expected to buy quantities this year. U.S. petrochemical plants are currently operating at about 90 pct capacity, reflecting tighter supply that could hike product prices by 30 to 40 pct this year, said John Dosher, managing director of Pace Consultants Inc of Houston. Demand for some products such as styrene could push profit margins up by as much as 300 pct, he said. Oreffice, speaking at a meeting of chemical engineers in Houston, said Dow would easily top the 741 mln dlrs it earned last year and predicted it would have the best year in its history. In 1985, when oil prices were still above 25 dlrs a barrel and chemical exports were adversely affected by the strong U.S. dollar, Dow had profits of 58 mln dlrs. I believe the entire chemical industry is headed for a record year or close to it, Oreffice said. GAF chairman Samuel Heyman estimated that the U.S. chemical industry would report a 20 pct gain in profits during 1987. Last year, the domestic industry earned a total of 13 billion dlrs, a 54 pct leap from 1985. The turn in the fortunes of the once-sickly chemical industry has been brought about by a combination of luck and planning, said Paces John Dosher. Dosher said last years fall in oil prices made feedstocks dramatically cheaper and at the same time the American dollar was weakening against foreign currencies. That helped boost U.S. chemical exports. Also helping to bring supply and demand into balance has been the gradual market absorption of the extra chemical manufacturing capacity created by Middle Eastern oil producers in the early 1980s. Finally, virtually all major U.S. chemical manufacturers have embarked on an extensive corporate restructuring program to mothball inefficient plants, trim the payroll and eliminate unrelated businesses. The restructuring touched off a flurry of friendly and hostile takeover attempts. GAF, which made an unsuccessful attempt in 1985 to acquire Union Carbide Corp UK, recently offered three billion dlrs for Borg Warner Corp BOR, a Chicago manufacturer of plastics and chemicals. Another industry powerhouse, W.R. Grace (GRA) has divested its retailing, restaurant and fertilizer businesses to raise cash for chemical acquisitions. But some experts worry that the chemical industry may be headed for trouble if companies continue turning their back on the manufacturing of staple petrochemical commodities, such as ethylene, in favor of more profitable specialty chemicals that are custom-designed for a small group of buyers. Companies like DuPont (DD) and Monsanto Co MTC spent the past two or three years trying to get out of the commodity chemical business in reaction to how badly the market had deteriorated, Dosher said. But I think they will eventually kill the margins on the profitable chemicals in the niche market. Some top chemical executives share the concern. The challenge for our industry is to keep from getting carried away and repeating past mistakes, GAFs Heyman cautioned. The shift from commodity chemicals may be ill-advised. Specialty businesses do not stay special long. Houston-based Cain Chemical, created this month by the Sterling investment banking group, believes it can generate 700 mln dlrs in annual sales by bucking the industry trend. Chairman Gordon Cain, who previously led a leveraged buyout of Duponts Conoco Incs chemical business, has spent 1.1 billion dlrs since January to buy seven petrochemical plants along the Texas Gulf Coast. The plants produce only basic commodity petrochemicals that are the building blocks of specialty products. This kind of commodity chemical business will never be a glamorous, high-margin business, Cain said, adding that demand is expected to grow by about three pct annually. Garo Armen, an analyst with Dean Witter Reynolds, said chemical makers have also benefitted by increasing demand for plastics as prices become more competitive with aluminum, wood and steel products. Armen estimated the upturn in the chemical business could last as long as four or five years, provided the U.S. economy continues its modest rate of growth.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/1976_Sabah_Air_GAF_Nomad_crash	http://dbpedia.org/resource/GAF_domain	http://dbpedia.org/resource/GAF_Nomad	http://dbpedia.org/resource/GAF_Jindivik	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Gaf
Edouard Saouma	285	299	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Edouard_Saouma	World output of staple foods maintained growth in 1986, following a record harvest the year before, and most of the increase was in developing countries, the director general of the U.N.s Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) said. Speaking to FAOs committee on world food security, Edouard Saouma said sub-Saharan Africa registered a cereal production increase of 3.6 pct in 1986 and the Far East also continued to increase production. Despite ample supplies worldwide, many countries face problems in paying for all the food they need, he said. Saouma said many of the developing worlds food problems were the result of chaotic world trade. He said it was vital to promote employment to improve the food-security situation of the poor, with policy reforms in developing countries to remove existing disincentives to production so that agriculture could play a greater role in stimulating economic growth.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tropical_Storm_Edouard_(2002)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Edouard_Cortès	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Frans_Hubert_Edouard_Arthur_Walter_Robyns	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Edouard_Mielche	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Edouard_d'Huart	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Charles_Edouard_Frère	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Albert_Edouard_Gilou	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Musée_Edouard_Branly	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Jules_Edouard_Roiné	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Edouard_Castres
Wall Street Journal	380	399	http://dbpedia.org/resource/The_Wall_Street_Journal	Securities and Exchange Commission John Shad said he wanted Congress to write a better definition of insider trading but thought action should wait until the Supreme Court ruled on an insider trading case. Id like the benefit of the Winans decision before deciding on a definition, Shad told a Senate Appropriations subcommittee hearing. Shad was refering to the appeal by former Wall Street Journal reporter R. Foster Winans of his conviction on insider trading charges for telling a friend in advance what stocks he was going to write about in his column. The stocks usually went up or down in price depending on Winans recommendation. He said insider trading accounted for only 11 percent of the SECs enforcement activities last year despite the publicity given to recent major cases. Insider trading makes up only a tiny fraction of one pct of the 50 billion dlrs of daily securities trading, Shad said. Shad asked for a budget increase so the SEC could enlarge its enforcement staff by 20 this year and 73 next year to deal with all types of securities fraud. Shad said he hoped to start his new duties as U.S. Ambassador to the Netherlands by June. He said he did not know when his successor would be named by President Reagan.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Journal_of_Orthopaedic_&_Sports_Physical_Therapy	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Kweilin_Street_Night_Market	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Market_Street_Halt_railway_station	http://dbpedia.org/resource/The_Little_Walls	http://dbpedia.org/resource/George_W._Wall_House	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Frame_(journal)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Armenian_Street,_Chennai	http://dbpedia.org/resource/190th_Street_(IND_Eighth_Avenue_Line)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Street_of_Dreams_(Guns_N'_Roses_song)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/The_New_Electric_Railway_Journal

Japans Finance Ministry	267	290	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ministry_of_Finance_(Japan)	Britain intends to negotiate further agreements on international securities regulation to match those now in force with the U.S. And Japan, government sources said. The Department of Trade and Industry said earlier it had concluded a memorandum of understanding with Japans Finance Ministry to swap supervisory and investigatory information. The agreement covers stocks, shares and government bonds, but not commodity futures, whose regulation in Japan does not come under the Finance Ministry. It therefore does not cover some transactions on the London International Financial Futures Exchange and the London commodities and metal exchanges. The DTI said it hoped to seek further understandings with other countries which met in the U.K. Last December. The meeting involved delegates from the U.K., Switzerland, the U.S., Canada, Australia, Hong Kong, Japan, France, West Germany and Holland. Government sources said the deal with Japan completes arrangements linking Tokyo, the U.S. And London. A U.K. Agreement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) was signed last September. Todays agreement will deal with requests for information on a case by case basis, U.K. Government sources said.

Ghana	1540	1545	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ghana	Major cocoa exporters are likely to limit sales in the weeks ahead in an effort to boost world prices, sources close to a meeting of the Cocoa Producers Alliance (CPA) said. The sources said the depressed world market had been one of the main topics discussed in a closed door meeting of the 11-member CPA which began on Monday. They said producers agreed that cutting sales would aid the buffer stock manager of a new international cocoa pact in his effort to support prices. Major cocoa producing and consuming nations agreed operation rules for the buffer stock at a meeting in London last month and the stock manager is expected to enter the market soon. Prices, under the weight of three successive cocoa surpluses, recently fell to the level at which the manager has to buy cocoa under stock rules. The buffer stock aims to keep prices within a pre-set range by buying when prices fall and selling when they rise. The worlds cocoa price at present is just not interesting, commented one delegate representing a major CPA producer. Another source said that with much of the 1986/87 (October-September) world cocoa crop sold, limiting sales in the near term concerns essentially next years harvest. The sources noted, however, that the cocoa industry in Brazil, the worlds number two producer, is in private hands. This means limiting sales is more difficult than in major West African producers, where sales are made or authorized by commodity marketing boards. The CPA includes the worlds top three producers, Ivory Coast, Brazil and Ghana, and accounts for 80 pct of all output. The meeting here is due to end tomorrow evening.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sport_Writers_Association_of_Ghana	http://dbpedia.org/resource/High_Commission_of_Ghana,_London	http://dbpedia.org/resource/E.tv_Ghana	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ghana_Player_of_the_Year	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Methodist_Church_Ghana	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ghana_Army	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tano_South_(Ghana_parliament_constituency)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ghana_Broadcasting_Corporation	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Culture_of_Ghana	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Wa_East_(Ghana_parliament_constituency)

Morgan	610	616	http://dbpedia.org/resource/J._P._Morgan	J.P. Morgan and Co Inc said its first-quarter earnings fell by 3.2 pct, largely reflecting its previously announced decision to place on non-accrual status its 1.3 billion dlrs of medium- and long-term loans to Brazil. That decision, spurred by Brazils suspension of interest payments on February 20, reduced the quarters net income by 20 mln dlrs to 226.4 mln dlrs, compared with 233.9 mln in the first three months of 1986. Morgan also reported a loss of 1.8 mln dlrs from securities underwriting and trading, in contrast to a gain of 45.4 mln dlrs in the year-earlier period. In the fourth quarter of 1986, Morgan posted other trading losses of 5.5 mln dlrs because of setbacks in the trading and underwriting of Euromarket securities. Conditions in some sectors of the Euromarket remained difficult last quarter, with floating rate notes suffering heavy price falls, but a spokeswoman was unable to say whether Morgans trading losses were restricted to the Euromarket. On the positive side, Morgan reduced its provision for loan losses to 35 mln dlrs from 70 mln a year earlier. Foreign exchange trading income rose to 82 mln dlrs from 72.6 mln and trust income increased to 95.9 mln dlrs from 75.9 mln. Morgan said other operating income, mainly fees and commissions, rose to 102.2 mln dlrs from 88.4 mln, but net investment securities gains dropped to 43.1 mln from 58.1 mln. Net interest earnings were 490.4 mln dlrs in the first quarter, down from 499.4 mln a year earlier, and net yield fell to 2.79 pct from 3.20 pct. If Brazil had not been placed on non-accrual, which means that interest can be recorded as income only when payments are actually received, net interest earnings would have been 525.9 mln dlrs and net yield 2.99 pct. If Brazil does not resume payments, 1987 net would be cut by 72 mln dlrs, Morgan added. After the provision for loan losses, Morgans allowance for credit losses at the end of March totaled 953 mln dlrs compared with 910 mln at end-1986 and 815 mln a year earlier. It reported net recoveries of six mln dlrs after charge-offs of eight mln, compared with net charge-offs of 49 mln dlrs after recoveries of three mln a year earlier. Excluding Brazil, non-accruing loans at quarters end were 583 mln dlrs, down from 633 mln at end-1986 and 684 mln a year earlier. Non-interest expenses rose to 371.1 mln dlrs from 303.5 mln dlrs, with more than half the increase related to personnel costs, Morgan said.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Kinder_Morgan_Energy_Partners	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Nancy_Morgan	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Morgan_Jones_1677_Pottery_Kiln	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Robin_Morgan_(journalist)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Craig_Morgan_(footballer)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/2011_Morgan_State_Bears_football_team	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Fieschi_Morgan_Staurotheke	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Morgan_Cox	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Morgan,_Walls_&_Clements	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thomas_Hunt_Morgan_bibliography

Monsanto Co	3597	3608	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Monsanto	Cheap oil feedstocks, the weakened U.S. dollar and a plant utilization rate approaching 90 pct will propel the streamlined U.S. petrochemical industry to record profits this year, with growth expected through at least 1990, major company executives predicted. This bullish outlook for chemical manufacturing and an industrywide move to shed unrelated businesses has prompted GAF Corp (GAF), privately-held Cain Chemical Inc, and other firms to aggressively seek acquisitions of petrochemical plants. Oil companies such as Ashland Oil Inc (ASH), the Kentucky-based oil refiner and marketer, are also shopping for money-making petrochemical businesses to buy. I see us poised at the threshold of a golden period, said Paul Oreffice, chairman of giant Dow Chemical Co (DOW), adding, Theres no major plant capacity being added around the world now. The whole game is bringing out new products and improving the old ones. Analysts say the chemical industrys biggest customers, automobile manufacturers and home builders that use a lot of paints and plastics, are expected to buy quantities this year.

Japan Air Lines Co Ltd	76	98	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Japan_Airlines	Faulty repair work by The Boeing Company BA.N was a contributary cause to a Japan Air Lines Co Ltd JAPN.Y 747 crash on August 12, 1985, that killed 520 people, the final draft of a Ministry of Transport report says. There were only four survivors when the aircraft crashed into a mountain north of Tokyo. The report said inadequate inspection of the aircraft by Japanese inspectors after the repairs was another factor in the crash. The crew were cleared of any responsibility for the disaster. The report, which was sent on March 23 to the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board for comment, should be released in late May. Under an international convention the draft must be submitted for final comments to the relevant authorities. Boeing spokesmen were unavailable for comment. On April 4, a Boeing spokesman at the firms headquarters said the company would probably make no comment on the Japanese investigation teams report until it was officially released. On September 6, 1985, Boeing said in a statement that the 1978 repairs it had undertaken were faulty. This statement did not, however, connect the faulty repairs with the cause of the crash.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/History_of_the_English_line_of_succession	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Rope_line	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Japan_National_Route_335	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dorset_Yacht_Co_Ltd_v_Home_Office	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Medallion_Air	http://dbpedia.org/resource/West_Wallsend_Steam_Tram_Line	http://dbpedia.org/resource/99th_Air_Refueling_Squadron	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Kisarazu_Air_Field	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tōbu_Sano_Line	http://dbpedia.org/resource/FIS_Freestyle_Ski_and_Snowboarding_World_Championships_2015_–_Men's_big_air
Burlington	1396	1406	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Burlington_Industries	The largest U.S. textile maker focused on its own business as its competitors found merger partners, but now Burlington Industries Inc may have restructured itself into an attractive takeover candidate, analysts said. The takeover spotlight fell today on Burlington, which rose 4-7/8 to 52-7/8 on speculation that investor Asher Edelman and Dominion Textiles Inc of Canada bought an almost five pct stake. A published report said Edelman and Dominion jointly acquired a stake in Burlington and were weighing a takeover offer. Edelman would not comment, and a spokesman for Montreal-based Dominion called the report just rumors. Burlington said it did not know if the report was true. Wall Street professionals said they were not convinced of the story or that Edelman and Dominion would be the victors if Burlington actually came into play. Arbitragers said past comments from Dominion, however, added credence to the speculation. Dominion has said that it was looking for a takeover in the U.S. Last year, Dominion unsuccessfully bid for Avondale Mills and has maintained a 120 mln dlr line of credit to be used for a U.S. acquisition. A Dominion spokesman said Canadas largest textile producer has been negotiating with many U.S. textile companies, but would not say whether Burlington was among them. There have been acquisitions in this area. Its not unusual that someone could be looking at Burlington after the housecleaning theyve done, said Eileen Gormley of Thomson McKinnon. Burlington sold its domestic operations, which made sheets and other linens, to J.P. Stevens and Co Inc for 110 mln dlrs last year. It also has reorganized management, and focused its operations on businesses that would be less affected by foreign competition, Gormley said. Theyve pulled back so as not to be a commodity marketer, said Gormley. She said in moving more heavily into industrial fabrics, Burlington bought C.H. Masland, which supplies carpets and other fabric to the auto industry. In the past, they just spent and never realized the return on the outlays they did make, she said. You look at their record over the year, and I think theyre poised to be more profitable than they had been in the past, Gormley said. She estimated 1987 earnings of 2.50 dlrs per share, up from 2.01 dlrs per share. Some analysts today recommended clients not buy Burlington at its current levels. Edward Johnson of Johnson Redbook said he recommends selling. He said he believes the stock is worth only about 50 dlrs on a takeover basis and about 46 dlrs on an earnings basis. Some arbitragers, however, said takeover values have been placed on the company of 60 to 65 dlrs per share. After Ashers (Edelman) recent history, a lot of people dont find him very credible anymore, said one arbitrager. Another, however, said Edelman succeeds in forcing managements to take steps to enhance shareholder values even if he doesnt win the target company. Edelman was unsuccessful last year in offers for Lucky Stores Inc and Fruehauf Corp. He did succeed in buying Ponderosa Inc. The stocks of other textile makers rose along with Burlington. J.P. Stevens STN climbed 5/8 to 44-7/8, and Fieldcrest Cannon Inc FLD, the result of a merger of Fieldcrest and Cannon, rose 1-1/8 to 39-3/4. West Point-Pepperell Inc WPM rose 1-7/8 to 67-1/8.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Burlington_Township_High_School	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Masonic_Temple_(Burlington,_Vermont)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Co-Cathedral_of_Saint_Joseph_(Burlington,_Vermont)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Times-News_(Burlington,_North_Carolina)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Richard_Boyle,_1st_Earl_of_Burlington	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Burlington_Braves	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Seal_of_Burlington_County,_New_Jersey	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Coast_Guard_Station_Burlington	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Downtown_Commercial_Historic_District_(Burlington,_Iowa)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Burlington_Rangers

U.K. Government	1179	1194	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Government_of_the_United_Kingdom	Britain intends to negotiate further agreements on international securities regulation to match those now in force with the U.S. And Japan, government sources said. The Department of Trade and Industry said earlier it had concluded a memorandum of understanding with Japans Finance Ministry to swap supervisory and investigatory information. The agreement covers stocks, shares and government bonds, but not commodity futures, whose regulation in Japan does not come under the Finance Ministry. It therefore does not cover some transactions on the London International Financial Futures Exchange and the London commodities and metal exchanges. The DTI said it hoped to seek further understandings with other countries which met in the U.K. Last December. The meeting involved delegates from the U.K., Switzerland, the U.S., Canada, Australia, Hong Kong, Japan, France, West Germany and Holland. Government sources said the deal with Japan completes arrangements linking Tokyo, the U.S. And London. A U.K. Agreement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) was signed last September. Todays agreement will deal with requests for information on a case by case basis, U.K. Government sources said.

Houston	4136	4143	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Houston	Cheap oil feedstocks, the weakened U.S. dollar and a plant utilization rate approaching 90 pct will propel the streamlined U.S. petrochemical industry to record profits this year, with growth expected through at least 1990, major company executives predicted. This bullish outlook for chemical manufacturing and an industrywide move to shed unrelated businesses has prompted GAF Corp (GAF), privately-held Cain Chemical Inc, and other firms to aggressively seek acquisitions of petrochemical plants. Oil companies such as Ashland Oil Inc (ASH), the Kentucky-based oil refiner and marketer, are also shopping for money-making petrochemical businesses to buy. I see us poised at the threshold of a golden period, said Paul Oreffice, chairman of giant Dow Chemical Co (DOW), adding, Theres no major plant capacity being added around the world now. The whole game is bringing out new products and improving the old ones. Analysts say the chemical industrys biggest customers, automobile manufacturers and home builders that use a lot of paints and plastics, are expected to buy quantities this year. U.S. petrochemical plants are currently operating at about 90 pct capacity, reflecting tighter supply that could hike product prices by 30 to 40 pct this year, said John Dosher, managing director of Pace Consultants Inc of Houston. Demand for some products such as styrene could push profit margins up by as much as 300 pct, he said. Oreffice, speaking at a meeting of chemical engineers in Houston, said Dow would easily top the 741 mln dlrs it earned last year and predicted it would have the best year in its history. In 1985, when oil prices were still above 25 dlrs a barrel and chemical exports were adversely affected by the strong U.S. dollar, Dow had profits of 58 mln dlrs. I believe the entire chemical industry is headed for a record year or close to it, Oreffice said. GAF chairman Samuel Heyman estimated that the U.S. chemical industry would report a 20 pct gain in profits during 1987. Last year, the domestic industry earned a total of 13 billion dlrs, a 54 pct leap from 1985. The turn in the fortunes of the once-sickly chemical industry has been brought about by a combination of luck and planning, said Paces John Dosher. Dosher said last years fall in oil prices made feedstocks dramatically cheaper and at the same time the American dollar was weakening against foreign currencies. That helped boost U.S. chemical exports. Also helping to bring supply and demand into balance has been the gradual market absorption of the extra chemical manufacturing capacity created by Middle Eastern oil producers in the early 1980s. Finally, virtually all major U.S. chemical manufacturers have embarked on an extensive corporate restructuring program to mothball inefficient plants, trim the payroll and eliminate unrelated businesses. The restructuring touched off a flurry of friendly and hostile takeover attempts. GAF, which made an unsuccessful attempt in 1985 to acquire Union Carbide Corp UK, recently offered three billion dlrs for Borg Warner Corp BOR, a Chicago manufacturer of plastics and chemicals. Another industry powerhouse, W.R. Grace (GRA) has divested its retailing, restaurant and fertilizer businesses to raise cash for chemical acquisitions. But some experts worry that the chemical industry may be headed for trouble if companies continue turning their back on the manufacturing of staple petrochemical commodities, such as ethylene, in favor of more profitable specialty chemicals that are custom-designed for a small group of buyers. Companies like DuPont (DD) and Monsanto Co MTC spent the past two or three years trying to get out of the commodity chemical business in reaction to how badly the market had deteriorated, Dosher said. But I think they will eventually kill the margins on the profitable chemicals in the niche market. Some top chemical executives share the concern. The challenge for our industry is to keep from getting carried away and repeating past mistakes, GAFs Heyman cautioned. The shift from commodity chemicals may be ill-advised. Specialty businesses do not stay special long. Houston-based Cain Chemical, created this month by the Sterling investment banking group, believes it can generate 700 mln dlrs in annual sales by bucking the industry trend. Chairman Gordon Cain, who previously led a leveraged buyout of Duponts Conoco Incs chemical business, has spent 1.1 billion dlrs since January to buy seven petrochemical plants along the Texas Gulf Coast. The plants produce only basic commodity petrochemicals that are the building blocks of specialty products. This kind of commodity chemical business will never be a glamorous, high-margin business, Cain said, adding that demand is expected to grow by about three pct annually. Garo Armen, an analyst with Dean Witter Reynolds, said chemical makers have also benefitted by increasing demand for plastics as prices become more competitive with aluminum, wood and steel products. Armen estimated the upturn in the chemical business could last as long as four or five years, provided the U.S. economy continues its modest rate of growth.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/2016–17_Houston_Cougars_women's_basketball_team	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Wilmington_Township,_Houston_County,_Minnesota	http://dbpedia.org/resource/1985_Houston_Oilers_season	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Houston_Jiménez	http://dbpedia.org/resource/List_of_Houston_Texans_Pro_Bowl_selections	http://dbpedia.org/resource/List_of_Houston_Rockets_first_and_second_round_draft_picks	http://dbpedia.org/resource/2002_Houston_Bowl	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Space_Center_Houston	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Houston_Lightning	http://dbpedia.org/resource/1995_Houston_Oilers_season
La Pampa	1749	1757	http://dbpedia.org/resource/La_Pampa_Province	Argentine grain producers adjusted their yield estimates for the 1986/87 coarse grain crop downward in the week to yesterday after the heavy rains at the end of March and beginning of April, trade sources said. They said sunflower, maize and sorghum production estimates had been reduced despite some later warm, dry weather, which has allowed a return to harvesting in some areas. However, as showers fell intermittently after last weekend, producers feared another spell of prolonged and intense rain could cause more damage to crops already badly hit this season. Rains in the middle of last week reached an average of 27 millimetres in parts of Buenos Aires province, 83 mm in Cordoba, 41 in Santa Fe, 50 in Entre Rios and Misiones, 95 in Corrientes, eight in Chaco and 35 in Formosa. There was no rainfall in the same period in La Pampa. Producers feared continued damp conditions could produce rotting and lead to still lower yield estimates for all the crops, including soybean. However, as the lands began drying later in the week harvesting advanced considerably, reaching between 36 and 40 pct of the area sown in the case of sunflower. Deterioration of the sunflower crop evident in harvested material in Cordoba, La Pampa and Buenos Aires forced yield estimates per hectare to be adjusted down again. The seasons sunflowerseed production is now forecast at 2.1 mln to 2.3 mln tonnes, against 2.2 mln to 2.4 mln forecast last week and down 43.9 to 48.8 pct on the 1985/86 record of 4.1 mln. Area sown to sunflowers was two to 2.2 mln hectares, 29.9 to 36.3 pct below the record 3.14 mln hectares last season. Maize harvesting has also reached 36 to 40 pct of the area sown. It is near completion in Cordoba and Santa Fe and will begin in La Pampa and southern Buenos Aires later in April. Production estimates for maize were down from last week at 9.5 mln to 9.8 mln tonnes, against 9.6 mln to 9.9 mln estimated previously. This is 22.2 to 23.4 pct below the 12.4 mln to 12.6 mln tonnes estimated by private sources for the 1985/86 crop and 21.9 to 25.8 pct down on the official figure of 12.8 mln tonnes. Maize was sown on 3.58 mln to 3.78 mln hectares, two to seven pct down on last seasons 3.85 mln. Sorghum was harvested on 23 to 25 pct of the area sown in Cordoba, Santa Fe and Chaco. Harvest will start in La Pampa and Buenos Aires in mid-April. The total area sown was 1.23 mln to 1.30 mln hectares, 10.3 to 15.2 pct down on the 1.45 mln sown last season. The new forecast for the sorghum crop is 2.9 mln to 3.2 mln tonnes compared with three mln to 3.3 mln forecast last week, and is 23.8 to 29.3 pct down on last seasons 4.1 mln to 4.2 mln tonne crop. The soybean crop for this season was not adjusted, remaining at a record 7.5 mln to 7.7 mln tonnes, up 4.2 to 5.5 pct on the 7.2 mln to 7.3 mln estimated by private sources for 1985/86 and 5.6 to 8.5 pct higher than the official figure of 7.1 mln. The area sown to soybeans this season was a record 3.7 mln to 3.8 mln hectares, 10.8 to 13.8 pct up on the record 3.34 mln sown in 1985/86. The soybean crop is showing excessive moisture in some areas and producers fear they may discover more damage. Some experimental harvesting was carried out in Santa Fe on areas making up only about one pct of the total crop but details on this were not available. Preparation of the fields for the 1987/88 wheat crop, which will be sown between May and August or September, has so far not been as intense as in previous years.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/La_Castañeda	http://dbpedia.org/resource/2006_Copa_de_la_Reina_de_Fútbol	http://dbpedia.org/resource/San_José_de_la_Estrella_metro_station	http://dbpedia.org/resource/La_Crosse_(grape)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/La_Chapelle-Cécelin	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Fresno_de_la_Vega	http://dbpedia.org/resource/La_Croix	http://dbpedia.org/resource/La_Gloria_Independent_School_District	http://dbpedia.org/resource/La_vida_no_vale_nada	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Nicolas_Gargot_de_la_Rochette

"We have now reached a key point in the development of communications devices that implement a worldwide ISDN standard, standard," said John East, group vice president for Advanced Micro's logic businesses. He said the companys logic businesses. He said the company's new computer chips, to be available by the end of this year, should boost the acceptance and implementation of ISDN services. The chip set includes five separate devices in 100 unit quantities. The devices are priced from 7.25 dlrs to 29.25 dlrs. Similar chip sets for ISDN communications are already being sold by a number of companies including INTEL Corp INTC, ATT, Rockwell International ROK and a joint venture between Northern Telecom LTd NT and Motorola Inc MOT. The ISDN standard, portions of which are still being defined, will provide for the simultaneous transmission of voice, data and video. Advanced Micro chip sets will be used in equipment such as private branch exchanges and desktop computers. The company also said it is developing an ISDN protocol controller. It said the controller will connect directly with its current line of ISDN devices. The device supports several digital communications protocols, including ones from International Business Machines Corp IBM and ATT.

Burlington	2344	2354	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Burlington_Industries	The largest U.S. textile maker focused on its own business as its competitors found merger partners, but now Burlington Industries Inc may have restructured itself into an attractive takeover candidate, analysts said. The takeover spotlight fell today on Burlington, which rose 4-7/8 to 52-7/8 on speculation that investor Asher Edelman and Dominion Textiles Inc of Canada bought an almost five pct stake. A published report said Edelman and Dominion jointly acquired a stake in Burlington and were weighing a takeover offer. Edelman would not comment, and a spokesman for Montreal-based Dominion called the report just rumors. Burlington said it did not know if the report was true. Wall Street professionals said they were not convinced of the story or that Edelman and Dominion would be the victors if Burlington actually came into play. Arbitragers said past comments from Dominion, however, added credence to the speculation. Dominion has said that it was looking for a takeover in the U.S. Last year, Dominion unsuccessfully bid for Avondale Mills and has maintained a 120 mln dlr line of credit to be used for a U.S. acquisition. A Dominion spokesman said Canadas largest textile producer has been negotiating with many U.S. textile companies, but would not say whether Burlington was among them. There have been acquisitions in this area. Its not unusual that someone could be looking at Burlington after the housecleaning theyve done, said Eileen Gormley of Thomson McKinnon. Burlington sold its domestic operations, which made sheets and other linens, to J.P. Stevens and Co Inc for 110 mln dlrs last year. It also has reorganized management, and focused its operations on businesses that would be less affected by foreign competition, Gormley said. Theyve pulled back so as not to be a commodity marketer, said Gormley. She said in moving more heavily into industrial fabrics, Burlington bought C.H. Masland, which supplies carpets and other fabric to the auto industry. In the past, they just spent and never realized the return on the outlays they did make, she said. You look at their record over the year, and I think theyre poised to be more profitable than they had been in the past, Gormley said. She estimated 1987 earnings of 2.50 dlrs per share, up from 2.01 dlrs per share. Some analysts today recommended clients not buy Burlington at its current levels. Edward Johnson of Johnson Redbook said he recommends selling. He said he believes the stock is worth only about 50 dlrs on a takeover basis and about 46 dlrs on an earnings basis. Some arbitragers, however, said takeover values have been placed on the company of 60 to 65 dlrs per share. After Ashers (Edelman) recent history, a lot of people dont find him very credible anymore, said one arbitrager. Another, however, said Edelman succeeds in forcing managements to take steps to enhance shareholder values even if he doesnt win the target company. Edelman was unsuccessful last year in offers for Lucky Stores Inc and Fruehauf Corp. He did succeed in buying Ponderosa Inc. The stocks of other textile makers rose along with Burlington. J.P. Stevens STN climbed 5/8 to 44-7/8, and Fieldcrest Cannon Inc FLD, the result of a merger of Fieldcrest and Cannon, rose 1-1/8 to 39-3/4. West Point-Pepperell Inc WPM rose 1-7/8 to 67-1/8.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Burlington_Township,_Lapeer_County,_Michigan	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Burlington_mayoral_election,_2009	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Fairview_(Burlington,_West_Virginia)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Burlington_Township_High_School	http://dbpedia.org/resource/West_Burlington,_Iowa	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Smithville,_Burlington_County,_New_Jersey	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Burlington_Island	http://dbpedia.org/resource/7_Burlington_Gardens	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Burlington_Municipal_Airport	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Burlington_Heights_(Ontario)

The company said, . The company said, "The tentative agreement protects UnionUnion's boundaries and also would set in motion a vote of UnionUnion's membership, which could lead to acquisition of Union by Public Service Co.." Union provides electrical service to about 14,000 members in cities and rural areas north of Denver. The company said the settlement, which is pending before the Colorado Public Utilities Commission, is under review by the Tri-State Generation and Transmission Association, which supplies power to Union, and is subject to approval by the Public Service Colorado board and UnionUnion's membership.

Buenos Aires	1771	1783	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Buenos_Aires_Province	Argentine grain producers adjusted their yield estimates for the 1986/87 coarse grain crop downward in the week to yesterday after the heavy rains at the end of March and beginning of April, trade sources said. They said sunflower, maize and sorghum production estimates had been reduced despite some later warm, dry weather, which has allowed a return to harvesting in some areas. However, as showers fell intermittently after last weekend, producers feared another spell of prolonged and intense rain could cause more damage to crops already badly hit this season. Rains in the middle of last week reached an average of 27 millimetres in parts of Buenos Aires province, 83 mm in Cordoba, 41 in Santa Fe, 50 in Entre Rios and Misiones, 95 in Corrientes, eight in Chaco and 35 in Formosa. There was no rainfall in the same period in La Pampa. Producers feared continued damp conditions could produce rotting and lead to still lower yield estimates for all the crops, including soybean. However, as the lands began drying later in the week harvesting advanced considerably, reaching between 36 and 40 pct of the area sown in the case of sunflower. Deterioration of the sunflower crop evident in harvested material in Cordoba, La Pampa and Buenos Aires forced yield estimates per hectare to be adjusted down again. The seasons sunflowerseed production is now forecast at 2.1 mln to 2.3 mln tonnes, against 2.2 mln to 2.4 mln forecast last week and down 43.9 to 48.8 pct on the 1985/86 record of 4.1 mln. Area sown to sunflowers was two to 2.2 mln hectares, 29.9 to 36.3 pct below the record 3.14 mln hectares last season. Maize harvesting has also reached 36 to 40 pct of the area sown. It is near completion in Cordoba and Santa Fe and will begin in La Pampa and southern Buenos Aires later in April. Production estimates for maize were down from last week at 9.5 mln to 9.8 mln tonnes, against 9.6 mln to 9.9 mln estimated previously. This is 22.2 to 23.4 pct below the 12.4 mln to 12.6 mln tonnes estimated by private sources for the 1985/86 crop and 21.9 to 25.8 pct down on the official figure of 12.8 mln tonnes. Maize was sown on 3.58 mln to 3.78 mln hectares, two to seven pct down on last seasons 3.85 mln. Sorghum was harvested on 23 to 25 pct of the area sown in Cordoba, Santa Fe and Chaco. Harvest will start in La Pampa and Buenos Aires in mid-April. The total area sown was 1.23 mln to 1.30 mln hectares, 10.3 to 15.2 pct down on the 1.45 mln sown last season. The new forecast for the sorghum crop is 2.9 mln to 3.2 mln tonnes compared with three mln to 3.3 mln forecast last week, and is 23.8 to 29.3 pct down on last seasons 4.1 mln to 4.2 mln tonne crop. The soybean crop for this season was not adjusted, remaining at a record 7.5 mln to 7.7 mln tonnes, up 4.2 to 5.5 pct on the 7.2 mln to 7.3 mln estimated by private sources for 1985/86 and 5.6 to 8.5 pct higher than the official figure of 7.1 mln. The area sown to soybeans this season was a record 3.7 mln to 3.8 mln hectares, 10.8 to 13.8 pct up on the record 3.34 mln sown in 1985/86. The soybean crop is showing excessive moisture in some areas and producers fear they may discover more damage. Some experimental harvesting was carried out in Santa Fe on areas making up only about one pct of the total crop but details on this were not available. Preparation of the fields for the 1987/88 wheat crop, which will be sown between May and August or September, has so far not been as intense as in previous years.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Buenas_noches,_Buenos_Aires	http://dbpedia.org/resource/1995_ATP_Buenos_Aires_–_Singles	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Buenos_Aires_Japanese_Gardens	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Once_-_30_de_Diciembre_(Buenos_Aires_Underground)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/General_Belgrano,_Buenos_Aires	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Buenos_Aires_Hardcore	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Buenos_Aires_English_High_School	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Buenos_Aires_Hockey_Association	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bulnes_(Buenos_Aires_Underground)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Santa_Teresita,_Buenos_Aires
Hong Kong	843	852	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hong_Kong	Britain intends to negotiate further agreements on international securities regulation to match those now in force with the U.S. And Japan, government sources said. The Department of Trade and Industry said earlier it had concluded a memorandum of understanding with Japans Finance Ministry to swap supervisory and investigatory information. The agreement covers stocks, shares and government bonds, but not commodity futures, whose regulation in Japan does not come under the Finance Ministry. It therefore does not cover some transactions on the London International Financial Futures Exchange and the London commodities and metal exchanges. The DTI said it hoped to seek further understandings with other countries which met in the U.K. Last December. The meeting involved delegates from the U.K., Switzerland, the U.S., Canada, Australia, Hong Kong, Japan, France, West Germany and Holland. Government sources said the deal with Japan completes arrangements linking Tokyo, the U.S. And London. A U.K. Agreement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) was signed last September. Todays agreement will deal with requests for information on a case by case basis, U.K. Government sources said. It is not legally binding and comes into force immediately.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hong_Kong_Amateur_Hockey_Club	http://dbpedia.org/resource/List_of_mosques_in_Hong_Kong	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hong_Kong_Film_Critics_Society	http://dbpedia.org/resource/29th_Hong_Kong_Film_Awards	http://dbpedia.org/resource/1974–75_Hong_Kong_First_Division_League	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Filipinos_in_Hong_Kong	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Television_in_Hong_Kong	http://dbpedia.org/resource/2006_Guangdong–Hong_Kong_Cup	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hong_Kong_at_the_2010_Asian_Para_Games	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hong_Kong_Third_A_Division_League

Dow Chemical Co	749	764	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dow_Chemical_Company	Cheap oil feedstocks, the weakened U.S. dollar and a plant utilization rate approaching 90 pct will propel the streamlined U.S. petrochemical industry to record profits this year, with growth expected through at least 1990, major company executives predicted. This bullish outlook for chemical manufacturing and an industrywide move to shed unrelated businesses has prompted GAF Corp (GAF), privately-held Cain Chemical Inc, and other firms to aggressively seek acquisitions of petrochemical plants. Oil companies such as Ashland Oil Inc (ASH), the Kentucky-based oil refiner and marketer, are also shopping for money-making petrochemical businesses to buy. I see us poised at the threshold of a golden period, said Paul Oreffice, chairman of giant Dow Chemical Co (DOW), adding, Theres no major plant capacity being added around the world now. The whole game is bringing out new products and improving the old ones. Analysts say the chemical industrys biggest customers, automobile manufacturers and home builders that use a lot of paints and plastics, are expected to buy quantities this year. U.S. petrochemical plants are currently operating at about 90 pct capacity, reflecting tighter supply that could hike product prices by 30 to 40 pct this year, said John Dosher, managing director of Pace Consultants Inc of Houston. Demand for some products such as styrene could push profit margins up by as much as 300 pct, he said. Oreffice, speaking at a meeting of chemical engineers in Houston, said Dow would easily top the 741 mln dlrs it earned last year and predicted it would have the best year in its history. In 1985, when oil prices were still above 25 dlrs a barrel and chemical exports were adversely affected by the strong U.S. dollar, Dow had profits of 58 mln dlrs. I believe the entire chemical industry is headed for a record year or close to it, Oreffice said. GAF chairman Samuel Heyman estimated that the U.S. chemical industry would report a 20 pct gain in profits during 1987. Last year, the domestic industry earned a total of 13 billion dlrs, a 54 pct leap from 1985. The turn in the fortunes of the once-sickly chemical industry has been brought about by a combination of luck and planning, said Paces John Dosher. Dosher said last years fall in oil prices made feedstocks dramatically cheaper and at the same time the American dollar was weakening against foreign currencies. That helped boost U.S. chemical exports. Also helping to bring supply and demand into balance has been the gradual market absorption of the extra chemical manufacturing capacity created by Middle Eastern oil producers in the early 1980s. Finally, virtually all major U.S. chemical manufacturers have embarked on an extensive corporate restructuring program to mothball inefficient plants, trim the payroll and eliminate unrelated businesses. The restructuring touched off a flurry of friendly and hostile takeover attempts. GAF, which made an unsuccessful attempt in 1985 to acquire Union Carbide Corp UK, recently offered three billion dlrs for Borg Warner Corp BOR, a Chicago manufacturer of plastics and chemicals. Another industry powerhouse, W.R. Grace (GRA) has divested its retailing, restaurant and fertilizer businesses to raise cash for chemical acquisitions. But some experts worry that the chemical industry may be headed for trouble if companies continue turning their back on the manufacturing of staple petrochemical commodities, such as ethylene, in favor of more profitable specialty chemicals that are custom-designed for a small group of buyers. Companies like DuPont (DD) and Monsanto Co MTC spent the past two or three years trying to get out of the commodity chemical business in reaction to how badly the market had deteriorated, Dosher said. But I think they will eventually kill the margins on the profitable chemicals in the niche market. Some top chemical executives share the concern. The challenge for our industry is to keep from getting carried away and repeating past mistakes, GAFs Heyman cautioned. The shift from commodity chemicals may be ill-advised. Specialty businesses do not stay special long. Houston-based Cain Chemical, created this month by the Sterling investment banking group, believes it can generate 700 mln dlrs in annual sales by bucking the industry trend. Chairman Gordon Cain, who previously led a leveraged buyout of Duponts Conoco Incs chemical business, has spent 1.1 billion dlrs since January to buy seven petrochemical plants along the Texas Gulf Coast. The plants produce only basic commodity petrochemicals that are the building blocks of specialty products. This kind of commodity chemical business will never be a glamorous, high-margin business, Cain said, adding that demand is expected to grow by about three pct annually. Garo Armen, an analyst with Dean Witter Reynolds, said chemical makers have also benefitted by increasing demand for plastics as prices become more competitive with aluminum, wood and steel products. Armen estimated the upturn in the chemical business could last as long as four or five years, provided the U.S. economy continues its modest rate of growth.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/ACS_Chemical_Biology	http://dbpedia.org/resource/List_of_U.S._chemical_weapons_topics	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Co-Cathedral_Basilica_of_the_Most_Holy_Trinity,_Chełmża	http://dbpedia.org/resource/W._Chamberlain_&_Co.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/D._Leonardt_&_Co.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/List_of_Italian_football_transfers_summer_2013_(co-ownership)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Co-amilofruse	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Max_Planck_Institute_for_Chemical_Ecology	http://dbpedia.org/resource/NLRB_v._Sands_Manufacturing_Co.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Norfolk_Southern_Railway_Co._v._James_N._Kirby,_Pty_Ltd.
Georgia Power	713	726	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Georgia_Power	An audit submitted to the Georgia Public Service Commission claims that between 944 mln dlrs and 1.8 billion dlrs of the costs of the Plant Vogtle nuclear power station should be disallowed, a Southern Co spokeswoman said. Southerns Georgia Power Co subsidiary has a 45.7 pct interest in the plant and estimated earlier this year it would cost a total of 8.87 billion dlrs. Last year, the plants owners pledged to Georgia regulators they would limit the cost passed on to rate payers to 8.4 billion dlrs. The Southern spokeswoman said the company feels the report by OBrien-Kreitzberg is flawed and biased. She said the report was released yesterday by the state attorney general. Responding to the report today, Georgia Power Chairman Robert W. Scherer told a news conference the conclusions drawn by the firm are not only wrong -- they also reflect the same bias against nuclear power that these auditors have demonstrated in similar cases accross the country. Saying he was not suggesting Georgia power was without fault, Scherer said the audit identified several things I wish we had done differently. Scherer pointed out a report OBrien-Kreitzberg submitted to Georgia regulators in March 1986 projected Georgia Power would not finish Plant Vogtle unit one before the end of 1987. Noting unit one is finished, and we expect it to be in commercial operationg by June, he said the firms latest report ignored the earlier projection, gave the utility no credit for the completion and actually penalized us by suggesting that costs to maintain t he schedule be disallowed. Scherer said the latest audit alleges Georgia Power could have saved 95 mln dlrs if it had stopped using four shifts, seven days a week to speed construction three years sooner. He said this would have delayed completion of the plant for another year and it would have cost several hunderd million dlrs more. Noting the audit said costs were increased 600 mln dlrs by schedule delays totaling 20.5 months, he said First, we have the best concrete placement record in the industry, Second new government regulations after the Three Mile Island incident significantly increased construction time.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Generac_Power_Systems	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Georgia_State_Route_63	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Power-on_hours	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Matarbari_Power_Plant	http://dbpedia.org/resource/University_of_Mississippi_Power_House	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Georgia_Dabritz	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Faridabad_Thermal_Power_Station	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Georgia_elections,_2014	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thalian_Hall_(Georgia)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Power_door_locks
Brazil	443	449	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Brazil	Storage problems with Brazils record grain crop are likely to result in losses of about five mln tonnes, an Agriculture Ministry spokesman said. Ministry spokesman Leonardo Brito, speaking from Brasilia, told Reuters he believed that about five mln tonnes of this years estimated crop of 65 mln tonnes would be lost. He said part of this would be the normal loss inevitable in harvesting, but that most of it would stem from storage problems. Brazil has a storage capacity of 66 mln tonnes, theoretically sufficient for the crop. But Brito said that the storage capacity was badly distributed. The states of Sao Paulo, Parana and Rio Grande do Sul had between them 70 pct of the nations capacity, but were responsible for only 50 to 60 pct of production. The biggest problems are concentrated in the Centre-West growing regions, where rising production has outpaced storage capacity. Brito said the Centre-West, whose crops include soya and maize, had between 30 and 40 pct of the nations grains production but only 20 pct of its storage space. In addition to the poor distribution of storage units, there is the problem that too much of the capacity is geared to storing grain in sacks, while not enough is suitable for storing loose grain, Brito said. Finally, there is a shortage of lorries to transport the crops. The sheer scale of the task in transporting the record crop has been evident from television reports, which have shown enormous queues of lorries waiting outside granaries.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Date_and_time_notation_in_Brazil	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Brazil_at_the_World_Artistic_Gymnastics_Championships	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Brazil_International	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Christian_Congregation_of_Brazil	http://dbpedia.org/resource/List_of_rivers_of_Federal_District_(Brazil)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Northeastern_Brazil_restingas	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Brazil_women's_national_under-20_football_team	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Brazil_at_the_2017_World_Games	http://dbpedia.org/resource/State_football_leagues_in_Brazil	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Corruption_in_Brazil

I see us poised at the threshold of a golden period, said Paul Oreffice, chairman of giant Dow Chemical Co (DOW), adding, Theres no major plant capacity being added around the world now. The whole game is bringing out new products and improving the old ones. Analysts say the chemical industrys biggest customers, automobile manufacturers and home builders that use a lot of paints and plastics, are expected to buy quantities this year. U.S. petrochemical plants are currently operating at about 90 pct capacity, reflecting tighter supply that could hike product prices by 30 to 40 pct this year, said John Dosher, managing director of Pace Consultants Inc of Houston. Demand for some products such as styrene could push profit margins up by as much as 300 pct, he said. Oreffice, speaking at a meeting of chemical engineers in Houston, said Dow would easily top the 741 mln dlrs it earned last year and predicted it would have the best year in its history. In 1985, when oil prices were still above 25 dlrs a barrel and chemical exports were adversely affected by the strong U.S. dollar, Dow had profits of 58 mln dlrs. I believe the entire chemical industry is headed for a record year or close to it, Oreffice said. GAF chairman Samuel Heyman estimated that the U.S. chemical industry would report a 20 pct gain in profits during 1987. Last year, the domestic industry earned a total of 13 billion dlrs, a 54 pct leap from 1985. The turn in the fortunes of the once-sickly chemical industry has been brought about by a combination of luck and planning, said Paces John Dosher. Dosher said last years fall in oil prices made feedstocks dramatically cheaper and at the same time the American dollar was weakening against foreign currencies. That helped boost U.S. chemical exports. Also helping to bring supply and demand into balance has been the gradual market absorption of the extra chemical manufacturing capacity created by Middle Eastern oil producers in the early 1980s. Finally, virtually all major U.S. chemical manufacturers have embarked on an extensive corporate restructuring program to mothball inefficient plants, trim the payroll and eliminate unrelated businesses. The restructuring touched off a flurry of friendly and hostile takeover attempts. GAF, which made an unsuccessful attempt in 1985 to acquire Union Carbide Corp UK, recently offered three billion dlrs for Borg Warner Corp BOR, a Chicago manufacturer of plastics and chemicals. Another industry powerhouse, W.R. Grace (GRA) has divested its retailing, restaurant and fertilizer businesses to raise cash for chemical acquisitions. But some experts worry that the chemical industry may be headed for trouble if companies continue turning their back on the manufacturing of staple petrochemical commodities, such as ethylene, in favor of more profitable specialty chemicals that are custom-designed for a small group of buyers. Companies like DuPont (DD) and Monsanto Co MTC spent the past two or three years trying to get out of the commodity chemical business in reaction to how badly the market had deteriorated, Dosher said. But I think they will eventually kill the margins on the profitable chemicals in the niche market. Some top chemical executives share the concern. The challenge for our industry is to keep from getting carried away and repeating past mistakes, GAFs Heyman cautioned. The shift from commodity chemicals may be ill-advised. Specialty businesses do not stay special long. Houston-based Cain Chemical, created this month by the Sterling investment banking group, believes it can generate 700 mln dlrs in annual sales by bucking the industry trend. Chairman Gordon Cain, who previously led a leveraged buyout of Duponts Conoco Incs chemical business, has spent 1.1 billion dlrs since January to buy seven petrochemical plants along the Texas Gulf Coast. The plants produce only basic commodity petrochemicals that are the building blocks of specialty products. This kind of commodity chemical business will never be a glamorous, high-margin business, Cain said, adding that demand is expected to grow by about three pct annually. Garo Armen, an analyst with Dean Witter Reynolds, said chemical makers have also benefitted by increasing demand for plastics as prices become more competitive with aluminum, wood and steel products. Armen estimated the upturn in the chemical business could last as long as four or five years, provided the U.S. economy continues its modest rate of growth.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cameron_Murray_(rugby_union)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Belleman's_Union_Church	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Northland_Rugby_Union	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Union_for_a_Popular_Movement_leadership_election,_2002	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Loleta_Union_School_District	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Union_Association	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Religion_in_the_Soviet_Union	http://dbpedia.org/resource/2006_Scotland_rugby_union_tour_of_South_Africa	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Imperial_College_School_of_Medicine_Students'_Union	http://dbpedia.org/resource/1984_New_Zealand_rugby_union_tour_of_Fiji
Miller	884	890	http://dbpedia.org/resource/James_C._Miller_III	Office of Management and Budget Director James Miller said President Reagan will reject the tax increase called for in the House Budget Committees 1988 budget proposal which is before the House for a vote today. Its just completely unacceptable, Miller told a House Appropriations subcommittee on Treasury, Postal Service and General Government Appropriations. The plan, drafted by the Democratic-controlled Budget committee, calls for 22 billion dlrs in higher revenues, of which 18 billion would be from new taxes set by the tax-writing committees. The House committees budget proposal includes some increases in federal user fees as well as 18 billion dlrs in taxes. Miller warned that failure to reduce the federal deficit would jeopardize the U.S. economy. If we do not further reduce the deficit... we place this economic expansion that weve had in the last five years at risk, Miller told the subcommittee. The result of any kind of tax increase would be to increase substantially the prospects that the expansion would come to an end, Miller said.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Howard_Miller_(minister)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Roger_Miller_(cricketer,_born_1972)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Jason_Miller_(ice_hockey)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ron_W._Miller	http://dbpedia.org/resource/William_Miller_(missionary)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ray_Miller_(journalist)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Britany_Miller	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Steven_J._Miller	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Millers_River_(Middlesex)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Roxy_Miller
Amsterdam bourse	925	941	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Amsterdam_Stock_Exchange	Dutch state-owned chemical firm NV DSM (DSMN.AS), the former Dutch state mines, which today reported a 2.5 pct increase in 1986 net profit to 412 mln guilders, said it was poised to be privatised, possibly next year. DSM chairman Hans van Liemt told journalists We have done our homework. Were ready. It is up to the state now. He said a public sale of 30 pct of DSMs assets in 1988 was not unlikely, but the timing of the sell-off was entirely in the hands of Parliament. Dutch Finance Minister Onno Ruding is known to be a proponent of privatisation, and the centre-right government coalition mentioned plans to privatise DSM in its policy declaration last autumn. Van Liemt would not speculate on a possible market price, but said his company had raised its total 1986 dividend to 98 mln guilders, almost 25 pct of 1986 net profit. We ought to be able to match our German competitors on price earnings ratio, although the Amsterdam bourse generally has a lower ratio than the worlds major exchanges,  he said. The average Dutch price/earnings ratio is 10.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/SS_Nieuw_Amsterdam_(1905)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Coat_of_arms_of_Amsterdam	http://dbpedia.org/resource/SAIL_Amsterdam	http://dbpedia.org/resource/2002_Amsterdam_Admirals_season	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Morey_Amsterdam	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Amsterdam_Institute_of_Molecules,_Medicines_and_Systems	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Amsterdam_Density_Functional	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Amsterdam_Diamond	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Oosterparkbuurt_(Amsterdam)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Rijkswerf_(Amsterdam)

Texaco Inc	69	79	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Chevron_Corporation	First Boston Corp analyst William Randol recommended the purchase of Texaco Inc today, saying the discount that investors have made in the share price to reflect the ongoing litigation with Pennzoil has been overdone relative to how we expect the case to conclude. Texacos stock rose 1/8 to 34-1/8. On Monday, the stock tumbled four points after the Supreme Court overturned a lower court decision that cut Texacos bond in the 10.3 billion dlr legal dispute with Pennzoil Co PZL to one billion dlrs. Yesterday, a Texas court granted a temporary injunction on the bond issue pending a hearing next week. The current litigation arose from Texacos buyout of Getty Oil Co in 1984. Pennzoil sued, arguing its earlier agreement to buy Getty was binding. Two Texas state courts upheld Pennzoils position. Randol, noting that the stock has suffered a great deal in the two years since the litigation was filed, said we recognize the legal problems but think investors have overdone it. He said the stock is selling at 48 pct of its asset value, and we think it represents a good value at this level.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Misery_Inc.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Byrd_v._Blue_Ridge_Rural_Electric_Cooperative,_Inc.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Facebook,_Inc._v._StudiVZ_Ltd.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ateam_Inc.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Luidia,_Inc.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/List_of_Infinity_Inc._members	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Online_Policy_Group_v._Diebold,_Inc.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Liberal_Arts,_Inc.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Geomedia_Inc.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/MGM_Studios,_Inc._v._Grokster,_Ltd.
Noranda	459	466	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Noranda_(mining_company)	Quebec mines minister Raymond Savoie said the province is prepared to offer money to help re-open (Noranda Inc))'s Murdochville, Quebec copper mine, shut down by fire last week, but said he could not give a specific figure until damage estimates have been completed. Federal member of parliament for the region,  Charles-Eugene Marin, said last week the federal government is also prepared to provide financial help to restart operations as soon as possible. Noranda has estimated damage from the fire at about 10 mln dlrs and a company spokesman said it should have a more specific estimate by the end of the month. Noranda said it had hoped to have an estimate sooner, but has found that it will take longer than expected to gain access to the burned-out area.

Dr. Steven Rosenberg	1852	1872	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Steven_Rosenberg	Promising new findings in the use of a controversial experimental drug called Interleukin-2 as a cure for cancer will be published in the April 9 issue of the prestigious New England Journal of Medicine, according to a Wall Street analyst who has obtained an advance copy of the magazine. Among interleukins principal U. S. makers are Cetus Corp CTUS, headquartered in Emeryville, Calif., and Immunex Corp IMNX, based in Seattle, Wash. The journal, to be released late today, contains two articles reporting high remission rates several cancer types. The journal also contains a signed editorial concluding that the new results mark a significant milestone in the search for a successful immunotherapy for cancer. Interleukin-2, also known as IL-2, is a substance naturally produced by living cells in the laboratory. The drug is controversial because it was widely praised as a promising cancer treatment in early reports on its effectiveness in late 1985, only to come under criticism a year later for its failure to live up to its promise and due to its ravaging side effects. One of the new studies, conducted by Dr. William West of Biotherapeutics Inc of Franklin, Tenn., is particularly significant because it found far fewer harsh side effects after it changed the way in which the drug is administered. In that study, researchers administered IL-2 to 48 cancer patients and found a 50-pct remission rate for kidney cancers and a 50 pct remission rate for melanoma, a type of skin cancer, according to Prudential-Bache Securities Stuart Weisbrod, who obtained the advance copy of the magazine. For rectal and colon cancer, the researchers found no remissions, but none of the 48 patients treated had side effects serious enough to be placed under intensive hospital care, according to the article. In the second study, whose principal author is Dr. Steven Rosenberg of the National Cancer Institute, researchers administered IL-2 to 157 cancer patients and found a 33 pct remission rate in cancers of the kidney, a 27 pct rate in melanomas and a 15 pct rate in cancers of the colon and rectum. In the National Cancer Institute trials, a total of four patients died, the magazine reported, confirming the harshness of the drugs side effects as originally administered. Perhaps we are at the end of the beginning of the search for successful immunotherapy for cancer, said the editorial, signed by John Durant of Philadelphias Chase Cancer Center. These observations reported by Rosenberg and West surely did not describe successful practical approaches ready for widespread applications in the therapy of cancer patients, the editorial said. On the other hand, if they reflect, as seems possible, a successful manipulation of the cellular immune system, then we may be near the end of our search for a meaningful direction in the immunuotherapy of cancer, the editorial concluded.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Steven_Geray	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Steven_Morales	http://dbpedia.org/resource/C._Steven_McGann	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Steven_Kent_Austin	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Steven_Bartlett	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Steven_Roesler	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Steven_Weissman	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Steven_Cheetham	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Steven_Thompson_(Scottish_footballer)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Steven_Stanley

Heyman	4016	4022	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Samuel_J._Heyman	Cheap oil feedstocks, the weakened U.S. dollar and a plant utilization rate approaching 90 pct will propel the streamlined U.S. petrochemical industry to record profits this year, with growth expected through at least 1990, major company executives predicted. This bullish outlook for chemical manufacturing and an industrywide move to shed unrelated businesses has prompted GAF Corp (GAF), privately-held Cain Chemical Inc, and other firms to aggressively seek acquisitions of petrochemical plants. Oil companies such as Ashland Oil Inc (ASH), the Kentucky-based oil refiner and marketer, are also shopping for money-making petrochemical businesses to buy. I see us poised at the threshold of a golden period, said Paul Oreffice, chairman of giant Dow Chemical Co (DOW), adding, Theres no major plant capacity being added around the world now. The whole game is bringing out new products and improving the old ones. Analysts say the chemical industrys biggest customers, automobile manufacturers and home builders that use a lot of paints and plastics, are expected to buy quantities this year. U.S. petrochemical plants are currently operating at about 90 pct capacity, reflecting tighter supply that could hike product prices by 30 to 40 pct this year, said John Dosher, managing director of Pace Consultants Inc of Houston. Demand for some products such as styrene could push profit margins up by as much as 300 pct, he said. Oreffice, speaking at a meeting of chemical engineers in Houston, said Dow would easily top the 741 mln dlrs it earned last year and predicted it would have the best year in its history. In 1985, when oil prices were still above 25 dlrs a barrel and chemical exports were adversely affected by the strong U.S. dollar, Dow had profits of 58 mln dlrs. I believe the entire chemical industry is headed for a record year or close to it, Oreffice said. GAF chairman Samuel Heyman estimated that the U.S. chemical industry would report a 20 pct gain in profits during 1987. Last year, the domestic industry earned a total of 13 billion dlrs, a 54 pct leap from 1985. The turn in the fortunes of the once-sickly chemical industry has been brought about by a combination of luck and planning, said Paces John Dosher. Dosher said last years fall in oil prices made feedstocks dramatically cheaper and at the same time the American dollar was weakening against foreign currencies. That helped boost U.S. chemical exports. Also helping to bring supply and demand into balance has been the gradual market absorption of the extra chemical manufacturing capacity created by Middle Eastern oil producers in the early 1980s. Finally, virtually all major U.S. chemical manufacturers have embarked on an extensive corporate restructuring program to mothball inefficient plants, trim the payroll and eliminate unrelated businesses. The restructuring touched off a flurry of friendly and hostile takeover attempts. GAF, which made an unsuccessful attempt in 1985 to acquire Union Carbide Corp UK, recently offered three billion dlrs for Borg Warner Corp BOR, a Chicago manufacturer of plastics and chemicals. Another industry powerhouse, W.R. Grace (GRA) has divested its retailing, restaurant and fertilizer businesses to raise cash for chemical acquisitions. But some experts worry that the chemical industry may be headed for trouble if companies continue turning their back on the manufacturing of staple petrochemical commodities, such as ethylene, in favor of more profitable specialty chemicals that are custom-designed for a small group of buyers. Companies like DuPont (DD) and Monsanto Co MTC spent the past two or three years trying to get out of the commodity chemical business in reaction to how badly the market had deteriorated, Dosher said. But I think they will eventually kill the margins on the profitable chemicals in the niche market. Some top chemical executives share the concern. The challenge for our industry is to keep from getting carried away and repeating past mistakes, GAFs Heyman cautioned. The shift from commodity chemicals may be ill-advised. Specialty businesses do not stay special long. Houston-based Cain Chemical, created this month by the Sterling investment banking group, believes it can generate 700 mln dlrs in annual sales by bucking the industry trend. Chairman Gordon Cain, who previously led a leveraged buyout of Duponts Conoco Incs chemical business, has spent 1.1 billion dlrs since January to buy seven petrochemical plants along the Texas Gulf Coast. The plants produce only basic commodity petrochemicals that are the building blocks of specialty products. This kind of commodity chemical business will never be a glamorous, high-margin business, Cain said, adding that demand is expected to grow by about three pct annually. Garo Armen, an analyst with Dean Witter Reynolds, said chemical makers have also benefitted by increasing demand for plastics as prices become more competitive with aluminum, wood and steel products. Armen estimated the upturn in the chemical business could last as long as four or five years, provided the U.S. economy continues its modest rate of growth.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Richard_A._Heyman	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bertha_Heyman	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Paul_Heyman	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Jared_Heyman	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Kathryn_Heyman	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Art_Heyman	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Heyman,_Iran	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Peter_Heyman	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sally_A._Heyman	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Preston_Heyman

Stockholm	354	363	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Stockholm	Plans to rejuvenate Polands economy by reducing central government control would help reassure Western creditors that the countrys economy was safe to invest in, a senior Polish official said. The business of granting loans to Poland is not as bad a business as you might imagine, senior Polish government spokesman Jerzy Urban told a news conference in Stockholm. Urban, visiting the Swedish capital to deliver a lecture at the Foreign Policy Institute, announced earlier this week that Poland would soon offer shares to private citizens in state companies in a bid to make the economy more responsive. This was part of a major economic reform to be announced in the coming weeks, he said. Urban said the main problem with his countrys foreign debt burden of 32 billion dollars was short term interest charges but the long term looked more secure. He said he hoped talks under way with the Paris Club, grouping Polands main government creditors, would shortly solve the problem of short term servicing. Urban told reporters that debt servicing was hampering the expansion of the national economy, but that the new plans for economic reform would open new vistas for Polish exports. He criticised the blocking efforts of some Western governments, whom he declined to name, for putting political considerations ahead of economic co-operation. After the lifting of U.S. Sanctions against the Polish economy we considered all political obstacles had been removed, but that has not been the case, Urban said.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Stockholm_Syndrome_(group)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Glory_1:_Stockholm	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Stockholm_Sweden_Temple	http://dbpedia.org/resource/1995_Stockholm_Open	http://dbpedia.org/resource/1972_Stockholm_Open	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Stockholm_Records	http://dbpedia.org/resource/List_of_novels_set_in_Stockholm	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Swedish_Theatre_(Stockholm)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Coat_of_arms_of_Stockholm	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Old_Stockholm_telephone_tower
Burlington	1888	1898	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Burlington_Industries	The largest U.S. textile maker focused on its own business as its competitors found merger partners, but now Burlington Industries Inc may have restructured itself into an attractive takeover candidate, analysts said. The takeover spotlight fell today on Burlington, which rose 4-7/8 to 52-7/8 on speculation that investor Asher Edelman and Dominion Textiles Inc of Canada bought an almost five pct stake. A published report said Edelman and Dominion jointly acquired a stake in Burlington and were weighing a takeover offer. Edelman would not comment, and a spokesman for Montreal-based Dominion called the report just rumors. Burlington said it did not know if the report was true. Wall Street professionals said they were not convinced of the story or that Edelman and Dominion would be the victors if Burlington actually came into play. Arbitragers said past comments from Dominion, however, added credence to the speculation. Dominion has said that it was looking for a takeover in the U.S. Last year, Dominion unsuccessfully bid for Avondale Mills and has maintained a 120 mln dlr line of credit to be used for a U.S. acquisition. A Dominion spokesman said Canadas largest textile producer has been negotiating with many U.S. textile companies, but would not say whether Burlington was among them. There have been acquisitions in this area. Its not unusual that someone could be looking at Burlington after the housecleaning theyve done, said Eileen Gormley of Thomson McKinnon. Burlington sold its domestic operations, which made sheets and other linens, to J.P. Stevens and Co Inc for 110 mln dlrs last year. It also has reorganized management, and focused its operations on businesses that would be less affected by foreign competition, Gormley said. Theyve pulled back so as not to be a commodity marketer, said Gormley. She said in moving more heavily into industrial fabrics, Burlington bought C.H. Masland, which supplies carpets and other fabric to the auto industry. In the past, they just spent and never realized the return on the outlays they did make, she said. You look at their record over the year, and I think theyre poised to be more profitable than they had been in the past, Gormley said. She estimated 1987 earnings of 2.50 dlrs per share, up from 2.01 dlrs per share. Some analysts today recommended clients not buy Burlington at its current levels. Edward Johnson of Johnson Redbook said he recommends selling. He said he believes the stock is worth only about 50 dlrs on a takeover basis and about 46 dlrs on an earnings basis. Some arbitragers, however, said takeover values have been placed on the company of 60 to 65 dlrs per share. After Ashers (Edelman) recent history, a lot of people dont find him very credible anymore, said one arbitrager. Another, however, said Edelman succeeds in forcing managements to take steps to enhance shareholder values even if he doesnt win the target company. Edelman was unsuccessful last year in offers for Lucky Stores Inc and Fruehauf Corp. He did succeed in buying Ponderosa Inc. The stocks of other textile makers rose along with Burlington. J.P. Stevens STN climbed 5/8 to 44-7/8, and Fieldcrest Cannon Inc FLD, the result of a merger of Fieldcrest and Cannon, rose 1-1/8 to 39-3/4. West Point-Pepperell Inc WPM rose 1-7/8 to 67-1/8.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Northern_Burlington_County_Regional_School_District	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Downtown_Burlington_Historic_District	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Burlington_City_Council	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Burlington_railroad_strike_of_1888	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Battery_Park_(Burlington,_Vermont)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Centerton,_Burlington_County,_New_Jersey	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Burlington_Community_Swimming_Pools_and_Bathhouse	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Burlington_Braves	http://dbpedia.org/resource/West_School_(Burlington,_Massachusetts)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Burlington,_Iowa

Netherlands	1134	1145	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Netherlands	Securities and Exchange Commission John Shad said he wanted Congress to write a better definition of insider trading but thought action should wait until the Supreme Court ruled on an insider trading case. Id like the benefit of the Winans decision before deciding on a definition, Shad told a Senate Appropriations subcommittee hearing. Shad was refering to the appeal by former Wall Street Journal reporter R. Foster Winans of his conviction on insider trading charges for telling a friend in advance what stocks he was going to write about in his column. The stocks usually went up or down in price depending on Winans recommendation. He said insider trading accounted for only 11 percent of the SECs enforcement activities last year despite the publicity given to recent major cases. Insider trading makes up only a tiny fraction of one pct of the 50 billion dlrs of daily securities trading, Shad said. Shad asked for a budget increase so the SEC could enlarge its enforcement staff by 20 this year and 73 next year to deal with all types of securities fraud. Shad said he hoped to start his new duties as U.S. Ambassador to the Netherlands by June. He said he did not know when his successor would be named by President Reagan.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Radio_10_(Netherlands)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/TUI_Airlines_Netherlands	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Juliana_of_the_Netherlands	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Boomerang_(Netherlands)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Netherlands_at_the_1906_Intercalated_Games	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Netherlands_at_the_2011_World_Championships_in_Athletics	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Provincial_road_N707_(Netherlands)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Etten,_Netherlands	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Netherlands_Centennial_Carillon	http://dbpedia.org/resource/A27_motorway_(Netherlands)

Zambian government	4	22	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Zambia	The Zambian government has no immediate plans to follow last weeks increase in the producer price of maize with a hike in the retail price of maize meal, an official of the ruling party said. Last December, a 120 pct increase in the consumer price for refined maize meal, a Zambian staple, led to food riots in which at least 15 people died. That price increase, which President Kenneth Kaunda later revoked, followed pressure by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to reduce the governments subsidy bill. However, if the producer price rise, from 6.10 dlrs to 8.67 dlrs per 90-kg bag, is not accompanied by a retail price increase, the government will have to spend more on subsidies, a practice discouraged by the IMF. There is no way out but to raise the subsidy levels of meal. It (the government) would have to choose between the demands of the IMF and those of the people, a Ministry of Agriculture economist said.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Singapore_Government_Enterprise_Architecture	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Provisional_Government_of_the_Republic_of_Poland	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Big_government	http://dbpedia.org/resource/2014_Belgian_government_formation	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Government_of_Dallas	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Government_of_South_Africa	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Zambian_general_election,_1978	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Government_Girls'_Postgraduate_College,_Rampur	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Government_of_Oregon	http://dbpedia.org/resource/E-Government_in_Pakistan
Emeryville	369	379	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Emeryville,_California	Promising new findings in the use of a controversial experimental drug called Interleukin-2 as a cure for cancer will be published in the April 9 issue of the prestigious New England Journal of Medicine, according to a Wall Street analyst who has obtained an advance copy of the magazine. Among interleukins principal U. S. makers are Cetus Corp CTUS, headquartered in Emeryville, Calif., and Immunex Corp IMNX, based in Seattle, Wash. The journal, to be released late today, contains two articles reporting high remission rates several cancer types. The journal also contains a signed editorial concluding that the new results mark a significant milestone in the search for a successful immunotherapy for cancer. Interleukin-2, also known as IL-2, is a substance naturally produced by living cells in the laboratory. The drug is controversial because it was widely praised as a promising cancer treatment in early reports on its effectiveness in late 1985, only to come under criticism a year later for its failure to live up to its promise and due to its ravaging side effects. One of the new studies, conducted by Dr. William West of Biotherapeutics Inc of Franklin, Tenn., is particularly significant because it found far fewer harsh side effects after it changed the way in which the drug is administered. In that study, researchers administered IL-2 to 48 cancer patients and found a 50-pct remission rate for kidney cancers and a 50 pct remission rate for melanoma, a type of skin cancer, according to Prudential-Bache Securities Stuart Weisbrod, who obtained the advance copy of the magazine. For rectal and colon cancer, the researchers found no remissions, but none of the 48 patients treated had side effects serious enough to be placed under intensive hospital care, according to the article. In the second study, whose principal author is Dr. Steven Rosenberg of the National Cancer Institute, researchers administered IL-2 to 157 cancer patients and found a 33 pct remission rate in cancers of the kidney, a 27 pct rate in melanomas and a 15 pct rate in cancers of the colon and rectum. In the National Cancer Institute trials, a total of four patients died, the magazine reported, confirming the harshness of the drugs side effects as originally administered. Perhaps we are at the end of the beginning of the search for successful immunotherapy for cancer, said the editorial, signed by John Durant of Philadelphias Chase Cancer Center. These observations reported by Rosenberg and West surely did not describe successful practical approaches ready for widespread applications in the therapy of cancer patients, the editorial said. On the other hand, if they reflect, as seems possible, a successful manipulation of the cellular immune system, then we may be near the end of our search for a meaningful direction in the immunuotherapy of cancer, the editorial concluded.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Shell_Development_Emeryville	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Emeryville_station	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bay_Street_Emeryville	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Emeryville_Shellmound	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Emeryville_Crescent_State_Marine_Reserve

The turn in the fortunes of the once-sickly chemical industry has been brought about by a combination of luck and planning, said Paces John Dosher. Dosher said last years fall in oil prices made feedstocks dramatically cheaper and at the same time the American dollar was weakening against foreign currencies. That helped boost U.S. chemical exports. Also helping to bring supply and demand into balance has been the gradual market absorption of the extra chemical manufacturing capacity created by Middle Eastern oil producers in the early 1980s. Finally, virtually all major U.S. chemical manufacturers have embarked on an extensive corporate restructuring program to mothball inefficient plants, trim the payroll and eliminate unrelated businesses. The restructuring touched off a flurry of friendly and hostile takeover attempts. GAF, which made an unsuccessful attempt in 1985 to acquire Union Carbide Corp UK, recently offered three billion dlrs for Borg Warner Corp BOR, a Chicago manufacturer of plastics and chemicals. Another industry powerhouse, W.R. Grace (GRA) has divested its retailing, restaurant and fertilizer businesses to raise cash for chemical acquisitions. But some experts worry that the chemical industry may be headed for trouble if companies continue turning their back on the manufacturing of staple petrochemical commodities, such as ethylene, in favor of more profitable specialty chemicals that are custom-designed for a small group of buyers. Companies like DuPont (DD) and Monsanto Co MTC spent the past two or three years trying to get out of the commodity chemical business in reaction to how badly the market had deteriorated, Dosher said. But I think they will eventually kill the margins on the profitable chemicals in the niche market. Some top chemical executives share the concern. The challenge for our industry is to keep from getting carried away and repeating past mistakes, GAFs Heyman cautioned. The shift from commodity chemicals may be ill-advised. Specialty businesses do not stay special long. Houston-based Cain Chemical, created this month by the Sterling investment banking group, believes it can generate 700 mln dlrs in annual sales by bucking the industry trend. Chairman Gordon Cain, who previously led a leveraged buyout of Duponts Conoco Incs chemical business, has spent 1.1 billion dlrs since January to buy seven petrochemical plants along the Texas Gulf Coast. The plants produce only basic commodity petrochemicals that are the building blocks of specialty products. This kind of commodity chemical business will never be a glamorous, high-margin business, Cain said, adding that demand is expected to grow by about three pct annually. Garo Armen, an analyst with Dean Witter Reynolds, said chemical makers have also benefitted by increasing demand for plastics as prices become more competitive with aluminum, wood and steel products. Armen estimated the upturn in the chemical business could last as long as four or five years, provided the U.S. economy continues its modest rate of growth.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hughie_Dow	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Harold_Dow_Bugbee	http://dbpedia.org/resource/2015_Dow_Corning_Tennis_Classic	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dow_Baraleh	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Alden_Dow_House_and_Studio	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Maxwell_v._Dow	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Joanne_Dow	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Paula_Dow	http://dbpedia.org/resource/2016_Dow_Corning_Tennis_Classic_–_Singles	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Arthur_Wesley_Dow

Fieldcrest	3213	3223	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cannon_Mills	The largest U.S. textile maker focused on its own business as its competitors found merger partners, but now Burlington Industries Inc may have restructured itself into an attractive takeover candidate, analysts said. The takeover spotlight fell today on Burlington, which rose 4-7/8 to 52-7/8 on speculation that investor Asher Edelman and Dominion Textiles Inc of Canada bought an almost five pct stake. A published report said Edelman and Dominion jointly acquired a stake in Burlington and were weighing a takeover offer. Edelman would not comment, and a spokesman for Montreal-based Dominion called the report just rumors. Burlington said it did not know if the report was true. Wall Street professionals said they were not convinced of the story or that Edelman and Dominion would be the victors if Burlington actually came into play. Arbitragers said past comments from Dominion, however, added credence to the speculation. Dominion has said that it was looking for a takeover in the U.S. Last year, Dominion unsuccessfully bid for Avondale Mills and has maintained a 120 mln dlr line of credit to be used for a U.S. acquisition. A Dominion spokesman said Canadas largest textile producer has been negotiating with many U.S. textile companies, but would not say whether Burlington was among them. There have been acquisitions in this area. Its not unusual that someone could be looking at Burlington after the housecleaning theyve done, said Eileen Gormley of Thomson McKinnon. Burlington sold its domestic operations, which made sheets and other linens, to J.P. Stevens and Co Inc for 110 mln dlrs last year. It also has reorganized management, and focused its operations on businesses that would be less affected by foreign competition, Gormley said. Theyve pulled back so as not to be a commodity marketer, said Gormley. She said in moving more heavily into industrial fabrics, Burlington bought C.H. Masland, which supplies carpets and other fabric to the auto industry. In the past, they just spent and never realized the return on the outlays they did make, she said. You look at their record over the year, and I think theyre poised to be more profitable than they had been in the past, Gormley said. She estimated 1987 earnings of 2.50 dlrs per share, up from 2.01 dlrs per share. Some analysts today recommended clients not buy Burlington at its current levels. Edward Johnson of Johnson Redbook said he recommends selling. He said he believes the stock is worth only about 50 dlrs on a takeover basis and about 46 dlrs on an earnings basis. Some arbitragers, however, said takeover values have been placed on the company of 60 to 65 dlrs per share. After Ashers (Edelman) recent history, a lot of people dont find him very credible anymore, said one arbitrager. Another, however, said Edelman succeeds in forcing managements to take steps to enhance shareholder values even if he doesnt win the target company. Edelman was unsuccessful last year in offers for Lucky Stores Inc and Fruehauf Corp. He did succeed in buying Ponderosa Inc. The stocks of other textile makers rose along with Burlington. J.P. Stevens STN climbed 5/8 to 44-7/8, and Fieldcrest Cannon Inc FLD, the result of a merger of Fieldcrest and Cannon, rose 1-1/8 to 39-3/4. West Point-Pepperell Inc WPM rose 1-7/8 to 67-1/8.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Fieldcrest_Cannon_Classic	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Fieldcrest,_West_Virginia
Mousavi	776	783	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mir-Hossein_Mousavi	Iran decided to continue its operations east of Basra to destroy Iraqs forces, Iranian Prime Minister Mir-Hossein Mousavi told Tehran Radio. That seems to be the best spot for the complete destruction of (Iraqi President) Saddams forces. This is why it was decided that the operations would forcefully continue there, he said. At the same time, we have maintained our ability to act throughout the length of the fronts, Mousavi told the radio, monitored by the British Broadcasting Corporation. Tehran Radio reported over 1,500 Iraqi casualties today as Iran continued its Karbala-8 operation launched early yesterday. Iran said over 2,600 Iraqis had been killed or wounded yesterday. Iraq said today its forces had beaten back the latest attacks inflicting heavy casualties. Mousavi told Tehran radio that on the whole, our advances have broken the back of the military forces of Saddam. Earlier today the Iranian news agency IRNA said Tehrans forces were stabilising new positions after their assault on Iraqi lines defending Basra, Iraqs second city. In Baghdad, a military spokesman said Iraqi warplanes today destroyed an oil pumping station and a production unit at Irans Ahvaz field.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Taraneh_Mousavi	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mohammad_Mofti-ol-shia_Mousavi	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Iman_Mousavi	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ali_Asghar_Al-Mousavi	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Jamaluddin_Mousavi	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Syed_Askar_Mousavi	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Government_of_Mir-Hossein_Mousavi_(1981–89)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Abdul-Karim_Mousavi_Ardebili	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Government_of_Mir-Hossein_Mousavi_(1985–89)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mohammad_Mousavi_Khoeiniha
Tenn	1170	1174	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tennessee	Promising new findings in the use of a controversial experimental drug called Interleukin-2 as a cure for cancer will be published in the April 9 issue of the prestigious New England Journal of Medicine, according to a Wall Street analyst who has obtained an advance copy of the magazine. Among interleukins principal U. S. makers are Cetus Corp CTUS, headquartered in Emeryville, Calif., and Immunex Corp IMNX, based in Seattle, Wash. The journal, to be released late today, contains two articles reporting high remission rates several cancer types. The journal also contains a signed editorial concluding that the new results mark a significant milestone in the search for a successful immunotherapy for cancer. Interleukin-2, also known as IL-2, is a substance naturally produced by living cells in the laboratory. The drug is controversial because it was widely praised as a promising cancer treatment in early reports on its effectiveness in late 1985, only to come under criticism a year later for its failure to live up to its promise and due to its ravaging side effects. One of the new studies, conducted by Dr. William West of Biotherapeutics Inc of Franklin, Tenn., is particularly significant because it found far fewer harsh side effects after it changed the way in which the drug is administered. In that study, researchers administered IL-2 to 48 cancer patients and found a 50-pct remission rate for kidney cancers and a 50 pct remission rate for melanoma, a type of skin cancer, according to Prudential-Bache Securities Stuart Weisbrod, who obtained the advance copy of the magazine. For rectal and colon cancer, the researchers found no remissions, but none of the 48 patients treated had side effects serious enough to be placed under intensive hospital care, according to the article. In the second study, whose principal author is Dr. Steven Rosenberg of the National Cancer Institute, researchers administered IL-2 to 157 cancer patients and found a 33 pct remission rate in cancers of the kidney, a 27 pct rate in melanomas and a 15 pct rate in cancers of the colon and rectum. In the National Cancer Institute trials, a total of four patients died, the magazine reported, confirming the harshness of the drugs side effects as originally administered. Perhaps we are at the end of the beginning of the search for successful immunotherapy for cancer, said the editorial, signed by John Durant of Philadelphias Chase Cancer Center. These observations reported by Rosenberg and West surely did not describe successful practical approaches ready for widespread applications in the therapy of cancer patients, the editorial said. On the other hand, if they reflect, as seems possible, a successful manipulation of the cellular immune system, then we may be near the end of our search for a meaningful direction in the immunuotherapy of cancer, the editorial concluded.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Alcoa_Tenn_Federal_Credit_Union	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Arthur_Tenn	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ten_Out_of_Tenn	http://dbpedia.org/resource/William_Tenn	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hoher_Tenn
IMF	852	855	http://dbpedia.org/resource/International_Monetary_Fund	The Zambian government has no immediate plans to follow last weeks increase in the producer price of maize with a hike in the retail price of maize meal, an official of the ruling party said. Last December, a 120 pct increase in the consumer price for refined maize meal, a Zambian staple, led to food riots in which at least 15 people died. That price increase, which President Kenneth Kaunda later revoked, followed pressure by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to reduce the governments subsidy bill. However, if the producer price rise, from 6.10 dlrs to 8.67 dlrs per 90-kg bag, is not accompanied by a retail price increase, the government will have to spend more on subsidies, a practice discouraged by the IMF. There is no way out but to raise the subsidy levels of meal.

Reagan	958	964	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ronald_Reagan	Senior Japanese officials tomorrow open talks with American trade negotiators in a last-ditch effort to avert new high U.S. tariffs to be imposed on a wide variety of Japanese electronic exports. Makoto Kuroda, vice minister of Japans Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI), is to hold two days of meetings with the Deputy U.S. Trade Representative, Michael Smith, and the Under Secretary of Commerce, Bruce Smart. The new tariffs, to go into effect on April 17, are in retaliation for Japans failure to adhere to an agreement to end dumping semiconductors in world markets at below cost and to open its home market to U.S. semiconductor shipments. They are to be imposed on goods which use semiconductors, including television and audio equipment and computers. Both U.S. and Japanese officials have said there was little likelihood the talks would do anything to avert the 100 pct duties on 300 mln dlrs worth of Japanese shipments. President Reagan announced the planned tariffs on March 27 after he said that close monitoring of the July 1986 U.S.-Japanese semiconductor pact convinced U.S. officials that Japan was not honoring the agreement. In making the annoucement, Reagan said I am committed to the full enforcement of our trade agreements designed to provide American industry with free and fair trade. Trade analysts said his move was aimed as much at Japans semiconductor trade practices, which are said to have injured the U.S. semiconductor industry, as Congress, which has complained about presidential timidity on trade issues. Congressional Democrats have pledged to enact aggressive trade laws to counter what they contend has been Reagans inaction to redress the growing U.S. trade deficit, which last year reached 169.8 billion dlrs. About one-third of the deficit was with Japan. Reagan said there were recent signs Japan was beginning to adhere to the pact and that was why he was not terminating it. Kuroda said on leaving Tokyo today he had no new proposals but did have an explanation of the semiconductor situation. He told the daily newspaper Ashai Shimbun that Reagans decision was based on inaccurate data and an exaggerated sense of MITIs power to control Japanese traders. The United States has excessive expectations., he said. To stabilize supply-demand relations which have been disrupted by excess inventories since 1985 will take some time. He also said that U.S. firms had not been aggressive enough in trying to sell in the Japanese market.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ronald_Reagan_UCLA_Medical_Center	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Reagan_County,_Texas	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ronald_Reagan_Washington_National_Airport_station	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Michele_Reagan	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Reagan_Field	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Denis_Reagan_Hurley	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Joshua_Reagan	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Reagan_Wickens	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ronald_Reagan_Presidential_Library	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Reagan_Democrat

Noranda has estimated damage from the fire at about 10 mln dlrs and a company spokesman said it should have a more specific estimate by the end of the month.

Morgan	2432	2438	http://dbpedia.org/resource/J._P._Morgan	J.P. Morgan and Co Inc said its first-quarter earnings fell by 3.2 pct, largely reflecting its previously announced decision to place on non-accrual status its 1.3 billion dlrs of medium- and long-term loans to Brazil. That decision, spurred by Brazils suspension of interest payments on February 20, reduced the quarters net income by 20 mln dlrs to 226.4 mln dlrs, compared with 233.9 mln in the first three months of 1986. Morgan also reported a loss of 1.8 mln dlrs from securities underwriting and trading, in contrast to a gain of 45.4 mln dlrs in the year-earlier period. In the fourth quarter of 1986, Morgan posted other trading losses of 5.5 mln dlrs because of setbacks in the trading and underwriting of Euromarket securities. Conditions in some sectors of the Euromarket remained difficult last quarter, with floating rate notes suffering heavy price falls, but a spokeswoman was unable to say whether Morgans trading losses were restricted to the Euromarket. On the positive side, Morgan reduced its provision for loan losses to 35 mln dlrs from 70 mln a year earlier. Foreign exchange trading income rose to 82 mln dlrs from 72.6 mln and trust income increased to 95.9 mln dlrs from 75.9 mln. Morgan said other operating income, mainly fees and commissions, rose to 102.2 mln dlrs from 88.4 mln, but net investment securities gains dropped to 43.1 mln from 58.1 mln. Net interest earnings were 490.4 mln dlrs in the first quarter, down from 499.4 mln a year earlier, and net yield fell to 2.79 pct from 3.20 pct. If Brazil had not been placed on non-accrual, which means that interest can be recorded as income only when payments are actually received, net interest earnings would have been 525.9 mln dlrs and net yield 2.99 pct. If Brazil does not resume payments, 1987 net would be cut by 72 mln dlrs, Morgan added. After the provision for loan losses, Morgans allowance for credit losses at the end of March totaled 953 mln dlrs compared with 910 mln at end-1986 and 815 mln a year earlier. It reported net recoveries of six mln dlrs after charge-offs of eight mln, compared with net charge-offs of 49 mln dlrs after recoveries of three mln a year earlier. Excluding Brazil, non-accruing loans at quarters end were 583 mln dlrs, down from 633 mln at end-1986 and 684 mln a year earlier. Non-interest expenses rose to 371.1 mln dlrs from 303.5 mln dlrs, with more than half the increase related to personnel costs, Morgan said.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Morgan_Brake_National_Wildlife_Refuge	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ken_Morgan_(politician)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Morgan_County_Schools_(West_Virginia)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Morgan_Tud	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Morgan_Marlborough	http://dbpedia.org/resource/David_Morgan_(swimmer)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Charles_Morgan_(1736–1787)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Morgan_Park_Academy	http://dbpedia.org/resource/DeMarco_Morgan	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ted_Morgan_(writer)
Boeing	738	744	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Boeing	Faulty repair work by The Boeing Company BA.N was a contributary cause to a Japan Air Lines Co Ltd JAPN.Y 747 crash on August 12, 1985, that killed 520 people, the final draft of a Ministry of Transport report says. There were only four survivors when the aircraft crashed into a mountain north of Tokyo. The report said inadequate inspection of the aircraft by Japanese inspectors after the repairs was another factor in the crash. The crew were cleared of any responsibility for the disaster. The report, which was sent on March 23 to the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board for comment, should be released in late May. Under an international convention the draft must be submitted for final comments to the relevant authorities. Boeing spokesmen were unavailable for comment. On April 4, a Boeing spokesman at the firms headquarters said the company would probably make no comment on the Japanese investigation teams report until it was officially released. On September 6, 1985, Boeing said in a statement that the 1978 repairs it had undertaken were faulty. This statement did not, however, connect the faulty repairs with the cause of the crash.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Boeing_747-400	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Boeing_727	http://dbpedia.org/resource/William_E._Boeing_Jr.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Boeing_KC-97_Stratofreighter	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Boeing_Galleries	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Boeing_Defense,_Space_&_Security	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Boeing_AH-64_Apache	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Boeing_XB-55	http://dbpedia.org/resource/USAAF_Boeing_B-17_crash_on_North_Barrule	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Boeing_601
Borg Warner Corp	3047	3063	http://dbpedia.org/resource/BorgWarner	Cheap oil feedstocks, the weakened U.S. dollar and a plant utilization rate approaching 90 pct will propel the streamlined U.S. petrochemical industry to record profits this year, with growth expected through at least 1990, major company executives predicted. This bullish outlook for chemical manufacturing and an industrywide move to shed unrelated businesses has prompted GAF Corp (GAF), privately-held Cain Chemical Inc, and other firms to aggressively seek acquisitions of petrochemical plants. Oil companies such as Ashland Oil Inc (ASH), the Kentucky-based oil refiner and marketer, are also shopping for money-making petrochemical businesses to buy. I see us poised at the threshold of a golden period, said Paul Oreffice, chairman of giant Dow Chemical Co (DOW), adding, Theres no major plant capacity being added around the world now. The whole game is bringing out new products and improving the old ones. Analysts say the chemical industrys biggest customers, automobile manufacturers and home builders that use a lot of paints and plastics, are expected to buy quantities this year. U.S. petrochemical plants are currently operating at about 90 pct capacity, reflecting tighter supply that could hike product prices by 30 to 40 pct this year, said John Dosher, managing director of Pace Consultants Inc of Houston. Demand for some products such as styrene could push profit margins up by as much as 300 pct, he said. Oreffice, speaking at a meeting of chemical engineers in Houston, said Dow would easily top the 741 mln dlrs it earned last year and predicted it would have the best year in its history. In 1985, when oil prices were still above 25 dlrs a barrel and chemical exports were adversely affected by the strong U.S. dollar, Dow had profits of 58 mln dlrs. I believe the entire chemical industry is headed for a record year or close to it, Oreffice said. GAF chairman Samuel Heyman estimated that the U.S. chemical industry would report a 20 pct gain in profits during 1987. Last year, the domestic industry earned a total of 13 billion dlrs, a 54 pct leap from 1985. The turn in the fortunes of the once-sickly chemical industry has been brought about by a combination of luck and planning, said Paces John Dosher. Dosher said last years fall in oil prices made feedstocks dramatically cheaper and at the same time the American dollar was weakening against foreign currencies. That helped boost U.S. chemical exports. Also helping to bring supply and demand into balance has been the gradual market absorption of the extra chemical manufacturing capacity created by Middle Eastern oil producers in the early 1980s. Finally, virtually all major U.S. chemical manufacturers have embarked on an extensive corporate restructuring program to mothball inefficient plants, trim the payroll and eliminate unrelated businesses. The restructuring touched off a flurry of friendly and hostile takeover attempts. GAF, which made an unsuccessful attempt in 1985 to acquire Union Carbide Corp UK, recently offered three billion dlrs for Borg Warner Corp BOR, a Chicago manufacturer of plastics and chemicals. Another industry powerhouse, W.R. Grace (GRA) has divested its retailing, restaurant and fertilizer businesses to raise cash for chemical acquisitions. But some experts worry that the chemical industry may be headed for trouble if companies continue turning their back on the manufacturing of staple petrochemical commodities, such as ethylene, in favor of more profitable specialty chemicals that are custom-designed for a small group of buyers. Companies like DuPont (DD) and Monsanto Co MTC spent the past two or three years trying to get out of the commodity chemical business in reaction to how badly the market had deteriorated, Dosher said. But I think they will eventually kill the margins on the profitable chemicals in the niche market. Some top chemical executives share the concern. The challenge for our industry is to keep from getting carried away and repeating past mistakes, GAFs Heyman cautioned. The shift from commodity chemicals may be ill-advised. Specialty businesses do not stay special long. Houston-based Cain Chemical, created this month by the Sterling investment banking group, believes it can generate 700 mln dlrs in annual sales by bucking the industry trend. Chairman Gordon Cain, who previously led a leveraged buyout of Duponts Conoco Incs chemical business, has spent 1.1 billion dlrs since January to buy seven petrochemical plants along the Texas Gulf Coast. The plants produce only basic commodity petrochemicals that are the building blocks of specialty products. This kind of commodity chemical business will never be a glamorous, high-margin business, Cain said, adding that demand is expected to grow by about three pct annually. Garo Armen, an analyst with Dean Witter Reynolds, said chemical makers have also benefitted by increasing demand for plastics as prices become more competitive with aluminum, wood and steel products. Armen estimated the upturn in the chemical business could last as long as four or five years, provided the U.S. economy continues its modest rate of growth.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Foresters'_Corps	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Marine_Corps_Air_Station_Kaneohe_Bay	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Anita_Borg	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Polish_Auxiliary_Corps	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Guy_Warner	http://dbpedia.org/resource/2nd_Army_Corps_(Russian_Empire)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/L_Army_Corps_(Wehrmacht)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Kevin_Borg	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bell_Atlantic_Corp._v._Twombly	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Zenith_Radio_Corp._v._Hazeltine_Research,_Inc.

Reagan	1188	1194	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ronald_Reagan	Senior Japanese officials tomorrow open talks with American trade negotiators in a last-ditch effort to avert new high U.S. tariffs to be imposed on a wide variety of Japanese electronic exports. Makoto Kuroda, vice minister of Japans Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI), is to hold two days of meetings with the Deputy U.S. Trade Representative, Michael Smith, and the Under Secretary of Commerce, Bruce Smart. The new tariffs, to go into effect on April 17, are in retaliation for Japans failure to adhere to an agreement to end dumping semiconductors in world markets at below cost and to open its home market to U.S. semiconductor shipments. They are to be imposed on goods which use semiconductors, including television and audio equipment and computers. Both U.S. and Japanese officials have said there was little likelihood the talks would do anything to avert the 100 pct duties on 300 mln dlrs worth of Japanese shipments. President Reagan announced the planned tariffs on March 27 after he said that close monitoring of the July 1986 U.S.-Japanese semiconductor pact convinced U.S. officials that Japan was not honoring the agreement. In making the annoucement, Reagan said I am committed to the full enforcement of our trade agreements designed to provide American industry with free and fair trade. Trade analysts said his move was aimed as much at Japans semiconductor trade practices, which are said to have injured the U.S. semiconductor industry, as Congress, which has complained about presidential timidity on trade issues. Congressional Democrats have pledged to enact aggressive trade laws to counter what they contend has been Reagans inaction to redress the growing U.S. trade deficit, which last year reached 169.8 billion dlrs. About one-third of the deficit was with Japan. Reagan said there were recent signs Japan was beginning to adhere to the pact and that was why he was not terminating it. Kuroda said on leaving Tokyo today he had no new proposals but did have an explanation of the semiconductor situation. He told the daily newspaper Ashai Shimbun that Reagans decision was based on inaccurate data and an exaggerated sense of MITIs power to control Japanese traders. The United States has excessive expectations., he said. To stabilize supply-demand relations which have been disrupted by excess inventories since 1985 will take some time. He also said that U.S. firms had not been aggressive enough in trying to sell in the Japanese market.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Reagan_Era	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Rip_Reagan	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Reagan_Singh	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Second_inauguration_of_Ronald_Reagan	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Presidency_of_Ronald_Reagan	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ronald_Wilson_Reagan_College_Preparatory_High_School	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Denis_Reagan_Hurley	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Reagan,_Oklahoma	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Foreign_policy_of_the_Ronald_Reagan_administration	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Death_and_state_funeral_of_Ronald_Reagan

Dealers said that Federal funds were trading at 6-7/16 pct when the Fed announced the operation. Economists had been expecting the Fed to do this because of the need to offset seasonal factors expected to drain reserves heavily over the next few weeks.

Finance Ministry	477	493	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ministry_of_Finance_(Japan)	Britain intends to negotiate further agreements on international securities regulation to match those now in force with the U.S. And Japan, government sources said. The Department of Trade and Industry said earlier it had concluded a memorandum of understanding with Japans Finance Ministry to swap supervisory and investigatory information. The agreement covers stocks, shares and government bonds, but not commodity futures, whose regulation in Japan does not come under the Finance Ministry. It therefore does not cover some transactions on the London International Financial Futures Exchange and the London commodities and metal exchanges. The DTI said it hoped to seek further understandings with other countries which met in the U.K. Last December. The meeting involved delegates from the U.K., Switzerland, the U.S., Canada, Australia, Hong Kong, Japan, France, West Germany and Holland. Government sources said the deal with Japan completes arrangements linking Tokyo, the U.S. And London. A U.K. Agreement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) was signed last September. Todays agreement will deal with requests for information on a case by case basis, U.K. Government sources said.

Agriculture Ministry	108	128	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ministry_of_Agriculture_(Brazil)	Storage problems with Brazils record grain crop are likely to result in losses of about five mln tonnes, an Agriculture Ministry spokesman said. Ministry spokesman Leonardo Brito, speaking from Brasilia, told Reuters he believed that about five mln tonnes of this years estimated crop of 65 mln tonnes would be lost. He said part of this would be the normal loss inevitable in harvesting, but that most of it would stem from storage problems. Brazil has a storage capacity of 66 mln tonnes, theoretically sufficient for the crop. But Brito said that the storage capacity was badly distributed. The states of Sao Paulo, Parana and Rio Grande do Sul had between them 70 pct of the nations capacity, but were responsible for only 50 to 60 pct of production. The biggest problems are concentrated in the Centre-West growing regions, where rising production has outpaced storage capacity. Brito said the Centre-West, whose crops include soya and maize, had between 30 and 40 pct of the nations grains production but only 20 pct of its storage space. In addition to the poor distribution of storage units, there is the problem that too much of the capacity is geared to storing grain in sacks, while not enough is suitable for storing loose grain, Brito said. Finally, there is a shortage of lorries to transport the crops. The sheer scale of the task in transporting the record crop has been evident from television reports, which have shown enormous queues of lorries waiting outside granaries.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ministry_of_Personnel,_Public_Grievances_and_Pensions	http://dbpedia.org/resource/United_States_Deputy_Secretary_of_Agriculture	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Agriculture_&_Consumer_Affairs_Committee_(Georgia_House)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/V._S._Achuthanandan_ministry	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Kharkiv_Petro_Vasylenko_National_Technical_University_of_Agriculture	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ministry_of_Agriculture_and_Forestry_(Equatorial_Guinea)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Rivers_State_Ministry_of_Agriculture	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ministry_of_Finance_(Netherlands)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Florida_Commissioner_of_Agriculture_election,_2006	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ministry_of_Interior,_Justice_and_Peace

Its just completely unacceptable, Miller told a House Appropriations subcommittee on Treasury, Postal Service and General Government Appropriations. The plan, drafted by the Democratic-controlled Budget committee, calls for 22 billion dlrs in higher revenues, of which 18 billion would be from new taxes set by the tax-writing committees. The House committees budget proposal includes some increases in federal user fees as well as 18 billion dlrs in taxes. Miller warned that failure to reduce the federal deficit would jeopardize the U.S. economy. If we do not further reduce the deficit... we place this economic expansion that weve had in the last five years at risk, Miller told the subcommittee. The result of any kind of tax increase would be to increase substantially the prospects that the expansion would come to an end, Miller said.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Postage_stamps_and_postal_history_of_the_Central_African_Republic	http://dbpedia.org/resource/List_of_football_clubs_in_Panama	http://dbpedia.org/resource/List_of_Garo:_Makai_no_Hana_episodes	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Glossary_of_Russian_and_USSR_aviation_acronyms:_Weapons_and_armament	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Canute_II_of_Sweden	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Athletics_at_the_1962_British_Empire_and_Commonwealth_Games_–_Women's_discus_throw	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Handcrafts_and_folk_art_in_Tlaxcala	http://dbpedia.org/resource/List_of_Peter_Simple_characters	http://dbpedia.org/resource/List_of_British_Basketball_League_seasons	http://dbpedia.org/resource/List_of_animated_television_series_of_1986
Dominion	1007	1015	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dominion_Textile	The largest U.S. textile maker focused on its own business as its competitors found merger partners, but now Burlington Industries Inc may have restructured itself into an attractive takeover candidate, analysts said. The takeover spotlight fell today on Burlington, which rose 4-7/8 to 52-7/8 on speculation that investor Asher Edelman and Dominion Textiles Inc of Canada bought an almost five pct stake. A published report said Edelman and Dominion jointly acquired a stake in Burlington and were weighing a takeover offer. Edelman would not comment, and a spokesman for Montreal-based Dominion called the report just rumors. Burlington said it did not know if the report was true. Wall Street professionals said they were not convinced of the story or that Edelman and Dominion would be the victors if Burlington actually came into play. Arbitragers said past comments from Dominion, however, added credence to the speculation. Dominion has said that it was looking for a takeover in the U.S. Last year, Dominion unsuccessfully bid for Avondale Mills and has maintained a 120 mln dlr line of credit to be used for a U.S. acquisition. A Dominion spokesman said Canadas largest textile producer has been negotiating with many U.S. textile companies, but would not say whether Burlington was among them. There have been acquisitions in this area. Its not unusual that someone could be looking at Burlington after the housecleaning theyve done, said Eileen Gormley of Thomson McKinnon. Burlington sold its domestic operations, which made sheets and other linens, to J.P. Stevens and Co Inc for 110 mln dlrs last year. It also has reorganized management, and focused its operations on businesses that would be less affected by foreign competition, Gormley said. Theyve pulled back so as not to be a commodity marketer, said Gormley. She said in moving more heavily into industrial fabrics, Burlington bought C.H. Masland, which supplies carpets and other fabric to the auto industry. In the past, they just spent and never realized the return on the outlays they did make, she said. You look at their record over the year, and I think theyre poised to be more profitable than they had been in the past, Gormley said. She estimated 1987 earnings of 2.50 dlrs per share, up from 2.01 dlrs per share. Some analysts today recommended clients not buy Burlington at its current levels. Edward Johnson of Johnson Redbook said he recommends selling. He said he believes the stock is worth only about 50 dlrs on a takeover basis and about 46 dlrs on an earnings basis. Some arbitragers, however, said takeover values have been placed on the company of 60 to 65 dlrs per share.

That seems to be the best spot for the complete destruction of (Iraqi President) Saddams forces. This is why it was decided that the operations would forcefully continue there, he said. At the same time, we have maintained our ability to act throughout the length of the fronts, Mousavi told the radio, monitored by the British Broadcasting Corporation. Tehran Radio reported over 1,500 Iraqi casualties today as Iran continued its Karbala-8 operation launched early yesterday. Iran said over 2,600 Iraqis had been killed or wounded yesterday. Iraq said today its forces had beaten back the latest attacks inflicting heavy casualties. Mousavi told Tehran radio that on the whole, our advances have broken the back of the military forces of Saddam. Earlier today the Iranian news agency IRNA said Tehrans forces were stabilising new positions after their assault on Iraqi lines defending Basra, Iraqs second city. In Baghdad, a military spokesman said Iraqi warplanes today destroyed an oil pumping station and a production unit at Irans Ahvaz field.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Japanese_Iraq_Reconstruction_and_Support_Group	http://dbpedia.org/resource/The_Iraq_Solidarity_Campaign	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Iraq–Ukraine_relations	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Polish_zone_in_Iraq	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Iraq_Today	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Iraq_national_football_team_all-time_record	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mahmoudiyah,_Iraq	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mangesh,_Iraq	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bodybuilding_in_Iraq	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Iraq_Freedom_Congress
Entre Rios	712	722	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Entre_Ríos_Province	Argentine grain producers adjusted their yield estimates for the 1986/87 coarse grain crop downward in the week to yesterday after the heavy rains at the end of March and beginning of April, trade sources said. They said sunflower, maize and sorghum production estimates had been reduced despite some later warm, dry weather, which has allowed a return to harvesting in some areas. However, as showers fell intermittently after last weekend, producers feared another spell of prolonged and intense rain could cause more damage to crops already badly hit this season. Rains in the middle of last week reached an average of 27 millimetres in parts of Buenos Aires province, 83 mm in Cordoba, 41 in Santa Fe, 50 in Entre Rios and Misiones, 95 in Corrientes, eight in Chaco and 35 in Formosa. There was no rainfall in the same period in La Pampa. Producers feared continued damp conditions could produce rotting and lead to still lower yield estimates for all the crops, including soybean. However, as the lands began drying later in the week harvesting advanced considerably, reaching between 36 and 40 pct of the area sown in the case of sunflower. Deterioration of the sunflower crop evident in harvested material in Cordoba, La Pampa and Buenos Aires forced yield estimates per hectare to be adjusted down again. The seasons sunflowerseed production is now forecast at 2.1 mln to 2.3 mln tonnes, against 2.2 mln to 2.4 mln forecast last week and down 43.9 to 48.8 pct on the 1985/86 record of 4.1 mln. Area sown to sunflowers was two to 2.2 mln hectares, 29.9 to 36.3 pct below the record 3.14 mln hectares last season. Maize harvesting has also reached 36 to 40 pct of the area sown. It is near completion in Cordoba and Santa Fe and will begin in La Pampa and southern Buenos Aires later in April. Production estimates for maize were down from last week at 9.5 mln to 9.8 mln tonnes, against 9.6 mln to 9.9 mln estimated previously. This is 22.2 to 23.4 pct below the 12.4 mln to 12.6 mln tonnes estimated by private sources for the 1985/86 crop and 21.9 to 25.8 pct down on the official figure of 12.8 mln tonnes. Maize was sown on 3.58 mln to 3.78 mln hectares, two to seven pct down on last seasons 3.85 mln. Sorghum was harvested on 23 to 25 pct of the area sown in Cordoba, Santa Fe and Chaco. Harvest will start in La Pampa and Buenos Aires in mid-April. The total area sown was 1.23 mln to 1.30 mln hectares, 10.3 to 15.2 pct down on the 1.45 mln sown last season. The new forecast for the sorghum crop is 2.9 mln to 3.2 mln tonnes compared with three mln to 3.3 mln forecast last week, and is 23.8 to 29.3 pct down on last seasons 4.1 mln to 4.2 mln tonne crop. The soybean crop for this season was not adjusted, remaining at a record 7.5 mln to 7.7 mln tonnes, up 4.2 to 5.5 pct on the 7.2 mln to 7.3 mln estimated by private sources for 1985/86 and 5.6 to 8.5 pct higher than the official figure of 7.1 mln. The area sown to soybeans this season was a record 3.7 mln to 3.8 mln hectares, 10.8 to 13.8 pct up on the record 3.34 mln sown in 1985/86. The soybean crop is showing excessive moisture in some areas and producers fear they may discover more damage. Some experimental harvesting was carried out in Santa Fe on areas making up only about one pct of the total crop but details on this were not available. Preparation of the fields for the 1987/88 wheat crop, which will be sown between May and August or September, has so far not been as intense as in previous years.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Rio_Grande's_Last_Race	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Rio_Sports_Club	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Legislative_Assembly_of_Rio_Grande_do_Sul	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Rio_Campo_Natural_Reserve	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Rio_Rita_(1942_film)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ernestina,_Rio_Grande_do_Sul	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Capivari_River_(Rio_de_Janeiro)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/2015_Rio_Open_–_Men's_Doubles	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pires_do_Rio	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Entre_Tangos_Y_Mariachi
James Miller	41	53	http://dbpedia.org/resource/James_C._Miller_III	Office of Management and Budget Director James Miller said President Reagan will reject the tax increase called for in the House Budget Committees 1988 budget proposal which is before the House for a vote today. Its just completely unacceptable, Miller told a House Appropriations subcommittee on Treasury, Postal Service and General Government Appropriations. The plan, drafted by the Democratic-controlled Budget committee, calls for 22 billion dlrs in higher revenues, of which 18 billion would be from new taxes set by the tax-writing committees. The House committees budget proposal includes some increases in federal user fees as well as 18 billion dlrs in taxes. Miller warned that failure to reduce the federal deficit would jeopardize the U.S. economy. If we do not further reduce the deficit... we place this economic expansion that weve had in the last five years at risk, Miller told the subcommittee. The result of any kind of tax increase would be to increase substantially the prospects that the expansion would come to an end, Miller said.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/James_Hay_Stevens	http://dbpedia.org/resource/James_Southerton	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Miller,_Oklahoma	http://dbpedia.org/resource/James_Ross_(Ontario_politician)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/James_Shaw_(mayor)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/James_McLean_(footballer,_born_1880)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/James_Pitman	http://dbpedia.org/resource/James_Halliday_(weightlifter)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/James_Bradley_Orman	http://dbpedia.org/resource/James_Burk

Dominion Textile Inc	0	20	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dominion_Textile	Dominion Textile Inc considers a published report that it has bought a stake in Burlington Industries Inc and is considering making a joint bid for the company to be a rumor, a company spokesman said. As far as I am concerned and the company is concerned, they are rumors and were not commenting on rumors, spokesman Michel Dufour told Reuters in response to a query. All the information that has been given out publicly is that, yes, Dominion Textile is interested in making an acquisition that big...probably based on that people are starting all sorts of rumors, he said. Dufour said yes when asked whether the report was only a rumor, but said the company was not prepared to comment further. Dominion Textile president and chairman Thomas Bell was out of town and unavailable for comment. Dominion Textile last year made an unsuccesful 104-mln- U.S.-dlr bid for Avondale Mills and has maintained a 120-mln- U.S.-dlr line of credit to be used for an American acquisition. Dufour said the company has been negotiating with many U.S. textile companies but would not say whether Burlington Industries was one of them. Burlingtons stock rose sharply this morning on the report, which said Dominion Textile had joined with U.S. investor Asher Edelman to buy a stake in the company and to consider making a takeover offer. Dominion Textile, which reported operating profit of 11.1 mln Canadian dlrs last year on sales of 926.5 mln dlrs, has repeatedly said it will concentrate on expanding into the U.S. The company has said it plans to diversify into new product and market areas in addition to expanding its textile operations.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/A.D._Bedell_Wholesale_Co.,_Inc._v._Philip_Morris_Inc.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Liberté_Inc.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Staple_(textiles)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Entergy_Corp._v._Riverkeeper_Inc.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Wharf_(Holdings)_Ltd._v._United_International_Holdings,_Inc.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Renaissance_E_Books,_Inc.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Halliburton_Co._v._Erica_P._John_Fund,_Inc.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/WinSystems,_Inc	http://dbpedia.org/resource/CyberCash,_Inc.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tree_Top,_Inc.

J.P. Stevens and Co Inc 	1565	1589	http://dbpedia.org/resource/WestPoint_Home	The largest U.S. textile maker focused on its own business as its competitors found merger partners, but now Burlington Industries Inc may have restructured itself into an attractive takeover candidate, analysts said. The takeover spotlight fell today on Burlington, which rose 4-7/8 to 52-7/8 on speculation that investor Asher Edelman and Dominion Textiles Inc of Canada bought an almost five pct stake. A published report said Edelman and Dominion jointly acquired a stake in Burlington and were weighing a takeover offer. Edelman would not comment, and a spokesman for Montreal-based Dominion called the report just rumors. Burlington said it did not know if the report was true. Wall Street professionals said they were not convinced of the story or that Edelman and Dominion would be the victors if Burlington actually came into play. Arbitragers said past comments from Dominion, however, added credence to the speculation. Dominion has said that it was looking for a takeover in the U.S. Last year, Dominion unsuccessfully bid for Avondale Mills and has maintained a 120 mln dlr line of credit to be used for a U.S. acquisition. A Dominion spokesman said Canadas largest textile producer has been negotiating with many U.S. textile companies, but would not say whether Burlington was among them. There have been acquisitions in this area. Its not unusual that someone could be looking at Burlington after the housecleaning theyve done, said Eileen Gormley of Thomson McKinnon. Burlington sold its domestic operations, which made sheets and other linens, to J.P. Stevens and Co Inc for 110 mln dlrs last year. It also has reorganized management, and focused its operations on businesses that would be less affected by foreign competition, Gormley said. Theyve pulled back so as not to be a commodity marketer, said Gormley. She said in moving more heavily into industrial fabrics, Burlington bought C.H. Masland, which supplies carpets and other fabric to the auto industry. In the past, they just spent and never realized the return on the outlays they did make, she said. You look at their record over the year, and I think theyre poised to be more profitable than they had been in the past, Gormley said. She estimated 1987 earnings of 2.50 dlrs per share, up from 2.01 dlrs per share. Some analysts today recommended clients not buy Burlington at its current levels. Edward Johnson of Johnson Redbook said he recommends selling. He said he believes the stock is worth only about 50 dlrs on a takeover basis and about 46 dlrs on an earnings basis. Some arbitragers, however, said takeover values have been placed on the company of 60 to 65 dlrs per share. After Ashers (Edelman) recent history, a lot of people dont find him very credible anymore, said one arbitrager. Another, however, said Edelman succeeds in forcing managements to take steps to enhance shareholder values even if he doesnt win the target company. Edelman was unsuccessful last year in offers for Lucky Stores Inc and Fruehauf Corp. He did succeed in buying Ponderosa Inc. The stocks of other textile makers rose along with Burlington. J.P. Stevens STN climbed 5/8 to 44-7/8, and Fieldcrest Cannon Inc FLD, the result of a merger of Fieldcrest and Cannon, rose 1-1/8 to 39-3/4.

GAF	1878	1881	http://dbpedia.org/resource/GAF_Materials_Corporation	Cheap oil feedstocks, the weakened U.S. dollar and a plant utilization rate approaching 90 pct will propel the streamlined U.S. petrochemical industry to record profits this year, with growth expected through at least 1990, major company executives predicted. This bullish outlook for chemical manufacturing and an industrywide move to shed unrelated businesses has prompted GAF Corp (GAF), privately-held Cain Chemical Inc, and other firms to aggressively seek acquisitions of petrochemical plants. Oil companies such as Ashland Oil Inc (ASH), the Kentucky-based oil refiner and marketer, are also shopping for money-making petrochemical businesses to buy. I see us poised at the threshold of a golden period, said Paul Oreffice, chairman of giant Dow Chemical Co (DOW), adding, Theres no major plant capacity being added around the world now. The whole game is bringing out new products and improving the old ones. Analysts say the chemical industrys biggest customers, automobile manufacturers and home builders that use a lot of paints and plastics, are expected to buy quantities this year. U.S. petrochemical plants are currently operating at about 90 pct capacity, reflecting tighter supply that could hike product prices by 30 to 40 pct this year, said John Dosher, managing director of Pace Consultants Inc of Houston. Demand for some products such as styrene could push profit margins up by as much as 300 pct, he said. Oreffice, speaking at a meeting of chemical engineers in Houston, said Dow would easily top the 741 mln dlrs it earned last year and predicted it would have the best year in its history. In 1985, when oil prices were still above 25 dlrs a barrel and chemical exports were adversely affected by the strong U.S. dollar, Dow had profits of 58 mln dlrs. I believe the entire chemical industry is headed for a record year or close to it, Oreffice said. GAF chairman Samuel Heyman estimated that the U.S. chemical industry would report a 20 pct gain in profits during 1987. Last year, the domestic industry earned a total of 13 billion dlrs, a 54 pct leap from 1985. The turn in the fortunes of the once-sickly chemical industry has been brought about by a combination of luck and planning, said Paces John Dosher. Dosher said last years fall in oil prices made feedstocks dramatically cheaper and at the same time the American dollar was weakening against foreign currencies. That helped boost U.S. chemical exports. Also helping to bring supply and demand into balance has been the gradual market absorption of the extra chemical manufacturing capacity created by Middle Eastern oil producers in the early 1980s. Finally, virtually all major U.S. chemical manufacturers have embarked on an extensive corporate restructuring program to mothball inefficient plants, trim the payroll and eliminate unrelated businesses. The restructuring touched off a flurry of friendly and hostile takeover attempts. GAF, which made an unsuccessful attempt in 1985 to acquire Union Carbide Corp UK, recently offered three billion dlrs for Borg Warner Corp BOR, a Chicago manufacturer of plastics and chemicals. Another industry powerhouse, W.R. Grace (GRA) has divested its retailing, restaurant and fertilizer businesses to raise cash for chemical acquisitions. But some experts worry that the chemical industry may be headed for trouble if companies continue turning their back on the manufacturing of staple petrochemical commodities, such as ethylene, in favor of more profitable specialty chemicals that are custom-designed for a small group of buyers. Companies like DuPont (DD) and Monsanto Co MTC spent the past two or three years trying to get out of the commodity chemical business in reaction to how badly the market had deteriorated, Dosher said. But I think they will eventually kill the margins on the profitable chemicals in the niche market. Some top chemical executives share the concern. The challenge for our industry is to keep from getting carried away and repeating past mistakes, GAFs Heyman cautioned. The shift from commodity chemicals may be ill-advised. Specialty businesses do not stay special long. Houston-based Cain Chemical, created this month by the Sterling investment banking group, believes it can generate 700 mln dlrs in annual sales by bucking the industry trend. Chairman Gordon Cain, who previously led a leveraged buyout of Duponts Conoco Incs chemical business, has spent 1.1 billion dlrs since January to buy seven petrochemical plants along the Texas Gulf Coast. The plants produce only basic commodity petrochemicals that are the building blocks of specialty products. This kind of commodity chemical business will never be a glamorous, high-margin business, Cain said, adding that demand is expected to grow by about three pct annually. Garo Armen, an analyst with Dean Witter Reynolds, said chemical makers have also benefitted by increasing demand for plastics as prices become more competitive with aluminum, wood and steel products. Armen estimated the upturn in the chemical business could last as long as four or five years, provided the U.S. economy continues its modest rate of growth.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/1976_Sabah_Air_GAF_Nomad_crash	http://dbpedia.org/resource/GAF_Jindivik	http://dbpedia.org/resource/GAF_Nomad	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Gaf	http://dbpedia.org/resource/GAF_domain

The one month suspension followed consultation with the Sydney Futures Exchange, SFE, which was liaising with Shintoh concerning the open positions of its clients, the CAC said. The South Australian CAC had applied for the appointment of a receiver and manager over the Adelaide office of Shintoh, an associate member of the SFE, the CAC said. Shintohs is the first licence suspended under a Futures Industry Code introduced by Australian states from July 1, 1986, SFE chief executive Les Hosking told Reuters.

Edelman	430	437	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Asher_Edelman	The largest U.S. textile maker focused on its own business as its competitors found merger partners, but now Burlington Industries Inc may have restructured itself into an attractive takeover candidate, analysts said. The takeover spotlight fell today on Burlington, which rose 4-7/8 to 52-7/8 on speculation that investor Asher Edelman and Dominion Textiles Inc of Canada bought an almost five pct stake. A published report said Edelman and Dominion jointly acquired a stake in Burlington and were weighing a takeover offer. Edelman would not comment, and a spokesman for Montreal-based Dominion called the report just rumors. Burlington said it did not know if the report was true. Wall Street professionals said they were not convinced of the story or that Edelman and Dominion would be the victors if Burlington actually came into play. Arbitragers said past comments from Dominion, however, added credence to the speculation. Dominion has said that it was looking for a takeover in the U.S. Last year, Dominion unsuccessfully bid for Avondale Mills and has maintained a 120 mln dlr line of credit to be used for a U.S. acquisition. A Dominion spokesman said Canadas largest textile producer has been negotiating with many U.S. textile companies, but would not say whether Burlington was among them. There have been acquisitions in this area. Its not unusual that someone could be looking at Burlington after the housecleaning theyve done, said Eileen Gormley of Thomson McKinnon. Burlington sold its domestic operations, which made sheets and other linens, to J.P. Stevens and Co Inc for 110 mln dlrs last year. It also has reorganized management, and focused its operations on businesses that would be less affected by foreign competition, Gormley said. Theyve pulled back so as not to be a commodity marketer, said Gormley. She said in moving more heavily into industrial fabrics, Burlington bought C.H. Masland, which supplies carpets and other fabric to the auto industry. In the past, they just spent and never realized the return on the outlays they did make, she said. You look at their record over the year, and I think theyre poised to be more profitable than they had been in the past, Gormley said. She estimated 1987 earnings of 2.50 dlrs per share, up from 2.01 dlrs per share. Some analysts today recommended clients not buy Burlington at its current levels. Edward Johnson of Johnson Redbook said he recommends selling. He said he believes the stock is worth only about 50 dlrs on a takeover basis and about 46 dlrs on an earnings basis.

Italy	18	23	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Italy	Montedison SPA of Italy said net consolidated profit for its Agrimont Group, formed in June 1986, totalled 1.5 billion lire in 1986. Agrimont SPA, the holding company for Montedisons Agro-Industrial businesses, had sales of 810 billion lire and a net profit of about 1.1 billion lire, after amortization costs of 35 billion lire and a 13 billion lire reduction in the value of inventory due to falling market prices, Montedison said. Agrimont, still wholly owned by Montedison, is taking steps to be traded on the Milan exchange, the company said. The company said that 1986 was characterized by an unstable fertlizer market due to the weak dollar and the decline of international prices for products sold in Europe and the U.S where Agrimont operates through its Conserv division. In pesticides and in animal health care products Agrimont maintained its previous level of revenues and market share in 1986, Montedison said. Montedison said it named Ettore dellIsola to the newly created position of president of Agrimont. Montedison also said it named Renato Picco, managing director of Eridania SPA and Gianfranco Ceroni, managing director of Italiana Olii e Sifi, both of whom are members of the the Ferruzzi Groups management board, to Argimonts board of directors. Ferruzzi owns about 40 pct of Montedison, the company said.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Italy–San_Marino_relations	http://dbpedia.org/resource/213th_Coastal_Division_(Italy)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/8th_Parachute_Assault_Engineer_Regiment_(Italy)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Communist_Platform_(Italy)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Crime_in_Italy	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Politics_of_Italy	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Young_Italy_(faction)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Italy_at_the_1952_Summer_Olympics	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Italy_in_the_Eurovision_Song_Contest_1987	http://dbpedia.org/resource/List_of_number-one_hits_of_1983_(Italy)
Burlington Industries Inc	80	105	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Burlington_Industries	Dominion Textile Inc considers a published report that it has bought a stake in Burlington Industries Inc and is considering making a joint bid for the company to be a rumor, a company spokesman said. As far as I am concerned and the company is concerned, they are rumors and were not commenting on rumors, spokesman Michel Dufour told Reuters in response to a query. All the information that has been given out publicly is that, yes, Dominion Textile is interested in making an acquisition that big...probably based on that people are starting all sorts of rumors, he said. Dufour said yes when asked whether the report was only a rumor, but said the company was not prepared to comment further. Dominion Textile president and chairman Thomas Bell was out of town and unavailable for comment. Dominion Textile last year made an unsuccesful 104-mln- U.S.-dlr bid for Avondale Mills and has maintained a 120-mln- U.S.-dlr line of credit to be used for an American acquisition. Dufour said the company has been negotiating with many U.S. textile companies but would not say whether Burlington Industries was one of them. Burlingtons stock rose sharply this morning on the report, which said Dominion Textile had joined with U.S. investor Asher Edelman to buy a stake in the company and to consider making a takeover offer. Dominion Textile, which reported operating profit of 11.1 mln Canadian dlrs last year on sales of 926.5 mln dlrs, has repeatedly said it will concentrate on expanding into the U.S. The company has said it plans to diversify into new product and market areas in addition to expanding its textile operations.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Reed_Elsevier,_Inc._v._Muchnick	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Safeway_Inc.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bangladesh_Chemical_Industries_Corporation	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Justice_Initiatives,_Inc.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/RJR-MacDonald_Inc_v_Canada_(AG)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/FOLMADS,_Inc.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Fishing_industry_in_Laos	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Marlboro,_Burlington_County,_New_Jersey	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Film_industry_in_Louisiana	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Entertainment_Industries
Plant Vogtle	1240	1252	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Vogtle_Electric_Generating_Plant	An audit submitted to the Georgia Public Service Commission claims that between 944 mln dlrs and 1.8 billion dlrs of the costs of the Plant Vogtle nuclear power station should be disallowed, a Southern Co spokeswoman said. Southerns Georgia Power Co subsidiary has a 45.7 pct interest in the plant and estimated earlier this year it would cost a total of 8.87 billion dlrs. Last year, the plants owners pledged to Georgia regulators they would limit the cost passed on to rate payers to 8.4 billion dlrs. The Southern spokeswoman said the company feels the report by OBrien-Kreitzberg is flawed and biased. She said the report was released yesterday by the state attorney general. Responding to the report today, Georgia Power Chairman Robert W. Scherer told a news conference the conclusions drawn by the firm are not only wrong -- they also reflect the same bias against nuclear power that these auditors have demonstrated in similar cases accross the country. Saying he was not suggesting Georgia power was without fault, Scherer said the audit identified several things I wish we had done differently. Scherer pointed out a report OBrien-Kreitzberg submitted to Georgia regulators in March 1986 projected Georgia Power would not finish Plant Vogtle unit one before the end of 1987. Noting unit one is finished, and we expect it to be in commercial operationg by June, he said the firms latest report ignored the earlier projection, gave the utility no credit for the completion and actually penalized us by suggesting that costs to maintain t he schedule be disallowed. Scherer said the latest audit alleges Georgia Power could have saved 95 mln dlrs if it had stopped using four shifts, seven days a week to speed construction three years sooner. He said this would have delayed completion of the plant for another year and it would have cost several hunderd million dlrs more. Noting the audit said costs were increased 600 mln dlrs by schedule delays totaling 20.5 months, he said First, we have the best concrete placement record in the industry, Second new government regulations after the Three Mile Island incident significantly increased construction time.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Blackheart_(plant_disease)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Siah_Bishe_Pumped_Storage_Power_Plant	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Perilla_(plant)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Plant_stem_cell	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dolgoprudnenskoe_Scientific_Production_Plant	http://dbpedia.org/resource/R.R._Donnelley_and_Sons_Co._Calumet_Plant	http://dbpedia.org/resource/816_Nuclear_Military_Plant	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Navia_(plant)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hura_(plant)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Plant_Disease_(journal)

Morgan	1208	1214	http://dbpedia.org/resource/J._P._Morgan	J.P. Morgan and Co Inc said its first-quarter earnings fell by 3.2 pct, largely reflecting its previously announced decision to place on non-accrual status its 1.3 billion dlrs of medium- and long-term loans to Brazil. That decision, spurred by Brazils suspension of interest payments on February 20, reduced the quarters net income by 20 mln dlrs to 226.4 mln dlrs, compared with 233.9 mln in the first three months of 1986. Morgan also reported a loss of 1.8 mln dlrs from securities underwriting and trading, in contrast to a gain of 45.4 mln dlrs in the year-earlier period. In the fourth quarter of 1986, Morgan posted other trading losses of 5.5 mln dlrs because of setbacks in the trading and underwriting of Euromarket securities. Conditions in some sectors of the Euromarket remained difficult last quarter, with floating rate notes suffering heavy price falls, but a spokeswoman was unable to say whether Morgans trading losses were restricted to the Euromarket. On the positive side, Morgan reduced its provision for loan losses to 35 mln dlrs from 70 mln a year earlier. Foreign exchange trading income rose to 82 mln dlrs from 72.6 mln and trust income increased to 95.9 mln dlrs from 75.9 mln. Morgan said other operating income, mainly fees and commissions, rose to 102.2 mln dlrs from 88.4 mln, but net investment securities gains dropped to 43.1 mln from 58.1 mln. Net interest earnings were 490.4 mln dlrs in the first quarter, down from 499.4 mln a year earlier, and net yield fell to 2.79 pct from 3.20 pct. If Brazil had not been placed on non-accrual, which means that interest can be recorded as income only when payments are actually received, net interest earnings would have been 525.9 mln dlrs and net yield 2.99 pct. If Brazil does not resume payments, 1987 net would be cut by 72 mln dlrs, Morgan added. After the provision for loan losses, Morgans allowance for credit losses at the end of March totaled 953 mln dlrs compared with 910 mln at end-1986 and 815 mln a year earlier. It reported net recoveries of six mln dlrs after charge-offs of eight mln, compared with net charge-offs of 49 mln dlrs after recoveries of three mln a year earlier. Excluding Brazil, non-accruing loans at quarters end were 583 mln dlrs, down from 633 mln at end-1986 and 684 mln a year earlier. Non-interest expenses rose to 371.1 mln dlrs from 303.5 mln dlrs, with more than half the increase related to personnel costs, Morgan said.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/The_Story_of_God_with_Morgan_Freeman	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Morgan_City,_Louisiana	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Morgan_Wootten	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Nicky_Morgan_(footballer)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Amari_Morgan-Smith	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Morgan_Murphy_(food_critic)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Morgan_Township,_Porter_County,_Indiana	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Morgan_County_Schools_(Alabama)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Charles_Morgan_(American_football)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dan_Morgan_(film)
Getty Oil Co	655	667	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Getty_Oil	First Boston Corp analyst William Randol recommended the purchase of Texaco Inc today, saying the discount that investors have made in the share price to reflect the ongoing litigation with Pennzoil has been overdone relative to how we expect the case to conclude. Texacos stock rose 1/8 to 34-1/8. On Monday, the stock tumbled four points after the Supreme Court overturned a lower court decision that cut Texacos bond in the 10.3 billion dlr legal dispute with Pennzoil Co PZL to one billion dlrs. Yesterday, a Texas court granted a temporary injunction on the bond issue pending a hearing next week. The current litigation arose from Texacos buyout of Getty Oil Co in 1984. Pennzoil sued, arguing its earlier agreement to buy Getty was binding. Two Texas state courts upheld Pennzoils position. Randol, noting that the stock has suffered a great deal in the two years since the litigation was filed, said we recognize the legal problems but think investors have overdone it. He said the stock is selling at 48 pct of its asset value, and we think it represents a good value at this level.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/M.A._Donohue_&_Co.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Oil_reserves_in_Venezuela	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Maizels,_Westerberg_&_Co.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Balthazar_Getty	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Co-Opertition_FIRST	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Backyard_Oil	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Wesco_(oil_company)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/World_Without_Oil	http://dbpedia.org/resource/The_Phone_Co-op	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bellows_Falls_Co-operative_Creamery_Complex

In the fourth quarter of 1986, Morgan posted other trading losses of 5.5 mln dlrs because of setbacks in the trading and underwriting of Euromarket securities. Conditions in some sectors of the Euromarket remained difficult last quarter, with floating rate notes suffering heavy price falls, but a spokeswoman was unable to say whether Morgans trading losses were restricted to the Euromarket. On the positive side, Morgan reduced its provision for loan losses to 35 mln dlrs from 70 mln a year earlier. Foreign exchange trading income rose to 82 mln dlrs from 72.6 mln and trust income increased to 95.9 mln dlrs from 75.9 mln. Morgan said other operating income, mainly fees and commissions, rose to 102.2 mln dlrs from 88.4 mln, but net investment securities gains dropped to 43.1 mln from 58.1 mln. Net interest earnings were 490.4 mln dlrs in the first quarter, down from 499.4 mln a year earlier, and net yield fell to 2.79 pct from 3.20 pct. If Brazil had not been placed on non-accrual, which means that interest can be recorded as income only when payments are actually received, net interest earnings would have been 525.9 mln dlrs and net yield 2.99 pct. If Brazil does not resume payments, 1987 net would be cut by 72 mln dlrs, Morgan added. After the provision for loan losses, Morgans allowance for credit losses at the end of March totaled 953 mln dlrs compared with 910 mln at end-1986 and 815 mln a year earlier. It reported net recoveries of six mln dlrs after charge-offs of eight mln, compared with net charge-offs of 49 mln dlrs after recoveries of three mln a year earlier. Excluding Brazil, non-accruing loans at quarters end were 583 mln dlrs, down from 633 mln at end-1986 and 684 mln a year earlier. Non-interest expenses rose to 371.1 mln dlrs from 303.5 mln dlrs, with more than half the increase related to personnel costs, Morgan said.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Kenneth_W._Morgan	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Morgans_Hotel	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Good_Love_(Meli'sa_Morgan_album)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/2011_Regions_Morgan_Keegan_Championships_–_Singles	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Devin_Morgan	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Morgan_Line	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Roy_Morgan_Research	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Morgan_William_II_O'Donovan	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Fourth_Morgan_ministry	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Brian_Morgan_(snooker_player)

Lucky Stores Inc	2977	2993	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Lucky_Stores	The largest U.S. textile maker focused on its own business as its competitors found merger partners, but now Burlington Industries Inc may have restructured itself into an attractive takeover candidate, analysts said. The takeover spotlight fell today on Burlington, which rose 4-7/8 to 52-7/8 on speculation that investor Asher Edelman and Dominion Textiles Inc of Canada bought an almost five pct stake. A published report said Edelman and Dominion jointly acquired a stake in Burlington and were weighing a takeover offer. Edelman would not comment, and a spokesman for Montreal-based Dominion called the report just rumors. Burlington said it did not know if the report was true. Wall Street professionals said they were not convinced of the story or that Edelman and Dominion would be the victors if Burlington actually came into play. Arbitragers said past comments from Dominion, however, added credence to the speculation. Dominion has said that it was looking for a takeover in the U.S. Last year, Dominion unsuccessfully bid for Avondale Mills and has maintained a 120 mln dlr line of credit to be used for a U.S. acquisition. A Dominion spokesman said Canadas largest textile producer has been negotiating with many U.S. textile companies, but would not say whether Burlington was among them. There have been acquisitions in this area. Its not unusual that someone could be looking at Burlington after the housecleaning theyve done, said Eileen Gormley of Thomson McKinnon. Burlington sold its domestic operations, which made sheets and other linens, to J.P. Stevens and Co Inc for 110 mln dlrs last year. It also has reorganized management, and focused its operations on businesses that would be less affected by foreign competition, Gormley said. Theyve pulled back so as not to be a commodity marketer, said Gormley. She said in moving more heavily into industrial fabrics, Burlington bought C.H. Masland, which supplies carpets and other fabric to the auto industry. In the past, they just spent and never realized the return on the outlays they did make, she said. You look at their record over the year, and I think theyre poised to be more profitable than they had been in the past, Gormley said. She estimated 1987 earnings of 2.50 dlrs per share, up from 2.01 dlrs per share. Some analysts today recommended clients not buy Burlington at its current levels. Edward Johnson of Johnson Redbook said he recommends selling. He said he believes the stock is worth only about 50 dlrs on a takeover basis and about 46 dlrs on an earnings basis. Some arbitragers, however, said takeover values have been placed on the company of 60 to 65 dlrs per share. After Ashers (Edelman) recent history, a lot of people dont find him very credible anymore, said one arbitrager. Another, however, said Edelman succeeds in forcing managements to take steps to enhance shareholder values even if he doesnt win the target company. Edelman was unsuccessful last year in offers for Lucky Stores Inc and Fruehauf Corp. He did succeed in buying Ponderosa Inc. The stocks of other textile makers rose along with Burlington. J.P. Stevens STN climbed 5/8 to 44-7/8, and Fieldcrest Cannon Inc FLD, the result of a merger of Fieldcrest and Cannon, rose 1-1/8 to 39-3/4.

Reuters	1112	1119	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Reuters	Exchanges and telecommunications authorities should abolish their restrictions on full and free dissemination of information to the investment and banking communities, Reuters Holdings Plc RTRS.L chairman Sir Christopher Hogg said. In the 1986 annual repoprt, he said lengthy negotiations had brought agreement with the Tokyo and London Stock Exchanges for fuller, but still not complete, access to market data through Reuter services. Many other markets maintain restrictions, he added. Hogg said members of some markets appear to believe that information restrictions protected their interests. In other cases, exchanges seem to be limiting the distribution of data in order to provide competitive advantage to their own commercial information businesses. He also noted that despite increasing liberalisation in the telecommunications field, some countries continue to protect their state monopolies at the expense of other economic sectors. Reuter dealing services remain excluded from such countries. As a result, banking communities serving entire economies are put at a competitive disadvantage, he added. Reuters increased its 1986 pre-tax profit by 39 pct from the previous year to 130.1 mln stg on a 43 pct rise in revenues to 620.9 mln stg. Earnings per ordinary share were up 47 pct to 19.4p.

Brasilia	194	202	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Brasília	Storage problems with Brazils record grain crop are likely to result in losses of about five mln tonnes, an Agriculture Ministry spokesman said. Ministry spokesman Leonardo Brito, speaking from Brasilia, told Reuters he believed that about five mln tonnes of this years estimated crop of 65 mln tonnes would be lost. He said part of this would be the normal loss inevitable in harvesting, but that most of it would stem from storage problems. Brazil has a storage capacity of 66 mln tonnes, theoretically sufficient for the crop. But Brito said that the storage capacity was badly distributed. The states of Sao Paulo, Parana and Rio Grande do Sul had between them 70 pct of the nations capacity, but were responsible for only 50 to 60 pct of production. The biggest problems are concentrated in the Centre-West growing regions, where rising production has outpaced storage capacity. Brito said the Centre-West, whose crops include soya and maize, had between 30 and 40 pct of the nations grains production but only 20 pct of its storage space. In addition to the poor distribution of storage units, there is the problem that too much of the capacity is geared to storing grain in sacks, while not enough is suitable for storing loose grain, Brito said. Finally, there is a shortage of lorries to transport the crops. The sheer scale of the task in transporting the record crop has been evident from television reports, which have shown enormous queues of lorries waiting outside granaries.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Carmen_Brasilia	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Club_Social,_Cultural_y_Deportivo_Brasilia	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Higher_Education_Institute_of_Brasilia	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Brasilia_TV_Tower	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Brasilia_Hip_Hop	http://dbpedia.org/resource/C.D._Brasilia	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Buckleria_brasilia	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Brasilia_Presidential_Act	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Brasilia_lyrefin	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Brasilia_Digital_TV_Tower

Rosenberg	2484	2493	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Steven_Rosenberg	Promising new findings in the use of a controversial experimental drug called Interleukin-2 as a cure for cancer will be published in the April 9 issue of the prestigious New England Journal of Medicine, according to a Wall Street analyst who has obtained an advance copy of the magazine. Among interleukins principal U. S. makers are Cetus Corp CTUS, headquartered in Emeryville, Calif., and Immunex Corp IMNX, based in Seattle, Wash. The journal, to be released late today, contains two articles reporting high remission rates several cancer types. The journal also contains a signed editorial concluding that the new results mark a significant milestone in the search for a successful immunotherapy for cancer. Interleukin-2, also known as IL-2, is a substance naturally produced by living cells in the laboratory. The drug is controversial because it was widely praised as a promising cancer treatment in early reports on its effectiveness in late 1985, only to come under criticism a year later for its failure to live up to its promise and due to its ravaging side effects. One of the new studies, conducted by Dr. William West of Biotherapeutics Inc of Franklin, Tenn., is particularly significant because it found far fewer harsh side effects after it changed the way in which the drug is administered. In that study, researchers administered IL-2 to 48 cancer patients and found a 50-pct remission rate for kidney cancers and a 50 pct remission rate for melanoma, a type of skin cancer, according to Prudential-Bache Securities Stuart Weisbrod, who obtained the advance copy of the magazine. For rectal and colon cancer, the researchers found no remissions, but none of the 48 patients treated had side effects serious enough to be placed under intensive hospital care, according to the article. In the second study, whose principal author is Dr. Steven Rosenberg of the National Cancer Institute, researchers administered IL-2 to 157 cancer patients and found a 33 pct remission rate in cancers of the kidney, a 27 pct rate in melanomas and a 15 pct rate in cancers of the colon and rectum. In the National Cancer Institute trials, a total of four patients died, the magazine reported, confirming the harshness of the drugs side effects as originally administered. Perhaps we are at the end of the beginning of the search for successful immunotherapy for cancer, said the editorial, signed by John Durant of Philadelphias Chase Cancer Center. These observations reported by Rosenberg and West surely did not describe successful practical approaches ready for widespread applications in the therapy of cancer patients, the editorial said. On the other hand, if they reflect, as seems possible, a successful manipulation of the cellular immune system, then we may be near the end of our search for a meaningful direction in the immunuotherapy of cancer, the editorial concluded.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Shmarya_Rosenberg	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Scott_Mitchell_Rosenberg	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Rosenberg_Glacier	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Saturday_Rosenberg	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Noah_Rosenberg	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Wilf_Rosenberg	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Jacob_Rosenberg	http://dbpedia.org/resource/John_Rosenberg_(American_football)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Joel_Rosenberg_(science_fiction_author)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Nikolay_Yakovlevich_Rosenberg

At the same time, we have maintained our ability to act throughout the length of the fronts, Mousavi told the radio, monitored by the British Broadcasting Corporation. Tehran Radio reported over 1,500 Iraqi casualties today as Iran continued its Karbala-8 operation launched early yesterday. Iran said over 2,600 Iraqis had been killed or wounded yesterday. Iraq said today its forces had beaten back the latest attacks inflicting heavy casualties. Mousavi told Tehran radio that on the whole, our advances have broken the back of the military forces of Saddam. Earlier today the Iranian news agency IRNA said Tehrans forces were stabilising new positions after their assault on Iraqi lines defending Basra, Iraqs second city.

Congress	60	68	http://dbpedia.org/resource/United_States_Congress	Securities and Exchange Commission John Shad said he wanted Congress to write a better definition of insider trading but thought action should wait until the Supreme Court ruled on an insider trading case. Id like the benefit of the Winans decision before deciding on a definition, Shad told a Senate Appropriations subcommittee hearing. Shad was refering to the appeal by former Wall Street Journal reporter R. Foster Winans of his conviction on insider trading charges for telling a friend in advance what stocks he was going to write about in his column. The stocks usually went up or down in price depending on Winans recommendation. He said insider trading accounted for only 11 percent of the SECs enforcement activities last year despite the publicity given to recent major cases. Insider trading makes up only a tiny fraction of one pct of the 50 billion dlrs of daily securities trading, Shad said. Shad asked for a budget increase so the SEC could enlarge its enforcement staff by 20 this year and 73 next year to deal with all types of securities fraud. Shad said he hoped to start his new duties as U.S. Ambassador to the Netherlands by June. He said he did not know when his successor would be named by President Reagan.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Jitendra_Singh_(Congress_politician)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/List_of_Members_of_the_United_States_House_of_Representatives_in_the_106th_Congress_by_seniority	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cáceres_(Spanish_Congress_electoral_district)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Shanghai_People's_Congress	http://dbpedia.org/resource/African_Americans_in_the_United_States_Congress	http://dbpedia.org/resource/National_Evangelical_Anglican_Congress	http://dbpedia.org/resource/80th_United_States_Congress	http://dbpedia.org/resource/United_Congress_(South_Africa)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/United_States_Congress_Joint_Committee_on_Reconstruction	http://dbpedia.org/resource/List_of_LGBT_members_of_the_United_States_Congress

Far East	391	399	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Far_East	World output of staple foods maintained growth in 1986, following a record harvest the year before, and most of the increase was in developing countries, the director general of the U.N.s Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) said. Speaking to FAOs committee on world food security, Edouard Saouma said sub-Saharan Africa registered a cereal production increase of 3.6 pct in 1986 and the Far East also continued to increase production. Despite ample supplies worldwide, many countries face problems in paying for all the food they need, he said. Saouma said many of the developing worlds food problems were the result of chaotic world trade. He said it was vital to promote employment to improve the food-security situation of the poor, with policy reforms in developing countries to remove existing disincentives to production so that agriculture could play a greater role in stimulating economic growth.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/List_of_listed_buildings_in_Aberlady,_East_Lothian	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Kent_East_(provincial_electoral_district)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Blackcap,_East_Sussex	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Far_from_Over_(Frank_Stallone_song)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Columbus_East_High_School	http://dbpedia.org/resource/East_Side_Militia	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ingrow_(East)_railway_station	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cardiff_East_(UK_Parliament_constituency)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/East_Globe,_Arizona	http://dbpedia.org/resource/East_End_(Waterbury)

National Cancer Institute	1880	1905	http://dbpedia.org/resource/National_Cancer_Institute	Promising new findings in the use of a controversial experimental drug called Interleukin-2 as a cure for cancer will be published in the April 9 issue of the prestigious New England Journal of Medicine, according to a Wall Street analyst who has obtained an advance copy of the magazine. Among interleukins principal U. S. makers are Cetus Corp CTUS, headquartered in Emeryville, Calif., and Immunex Corp IMNX, based in Seattle, Wash. The journal, to be released late today, contains two articles reporting high remission rates several cancer types. The journal also contains a signed editorial concluding that the new results mark a significant milestone in the search for a successful immunotherapy for cancer. Interleukin-2, also known as IL-2, is a substance naturally produced by living cells in the laboratory. The drug is controversial because it was widely praised as a promising cancer treatment in early reports on its effectiveness in late 1985, only to come under criticism a year later for its failure to live up to its promise and due to its ravaging side effects. One of the new studies, conducted by Dr. William West of Biotherapeutics Inc of Franklin, Tenn., is particularly significant because it found far fewer harsh side effects after it changed the way in which the drug is administered. In that study, researchers administered IL-2 to 48 cancer patients and found a 50-pct remission rate for kidney cancers and a 50 pct remission rate for melanoma, a type of skin cancer, according to Prudential-Bache Securities Stuart Weisbrod, who obtained the advance copy of the magazine. For rectal and colon cancer, the researchers found no remissions, but none of the 48 patients treated had side effects serious enough to be placed under intensive hospital care, according to the article. In the second study, whose principal author is Dr. Steven Rosenberg of the National Cancer Institute, researchers administered IL-2 to 157 cancer patients and found a 33 pct remission rate in cancers of the kidney, a 27 pct rate in melanomas and a 15 pct rate in cancers of the colon and rectum. In the National Cancer Institute trials, a total of four patients died, the magazine reported, confirming the harshness of the drugs side effects as originally administered. Perhaps we are at the end of the beginning of the search for successful immunotherapy for cancer, said the editorial, signed by John Durant of Philadelphias Chase Cancer Center. These observations reported by Rosenberg and West surely did not describe successful practical approaches ready for widespread applications in the therapy of cancer patients, the editorial said. On the other hand, if they reflect, as seems possible, a successful manipulation of the cellular immune system, then we may be near the end of our search for a meaningful direction in the immunuotherapy of cancer, the editorial concluded.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Citizens_&_Southern_National_Bank	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hungary_national_speedway_team	http://dbpedia.org/resource/National_Scholastic_Press_Association	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hot_Springs_(Big_Bend_National_Park)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/National_Youth_Theatre	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Wales_national_football_team_manager	http://dbpedia.org/resource/National_Register_of_Historic_Places_listings_in_Allegheny_County,_Pennsylvania	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bladensburg_National_Park	http://dbpedia.org/resource/National_road_91_(Poland)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/The_James_Cancer_Hospital
Mir-Hossein Mousavi	102	121	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mir-Hossein_Mousavi	Iran decided to continue its operations east of Basra to destroy Iraqs forces, Iranian Prime Minister Mir-Hossein Mousavi told Tehran Radio. That seems to be the best spot for the complete destruction of (Iraqi President) Saddams forces. This is why it was decided that the operations would forcefully continue there, he said. At the same time, we have maintained our ability to act throughout the length of the fronts, Mousavi told the radio, monitored by the British Broadcasting Corporation. Tehran Radio reported over 1,500 Iraqi casualties today as Iran continued its Karbala-8 operation launched early yesterday. Iran said over 2,600 Iraqis had been killed or wounded yesterday. Iraq said today its forces had beaten back the latest attacks inflicting heavy casualties. Mousavi told Tehran radio that on the whole, our advances have broken the back of the military forces of Saddam. Earlier today the Iranian news agency IRNA said Tehrans forces were stabilising new positions after their assault on Iraqi lines defending Basra, Iraqs second city. In Baghdad, a military spokesman said Iraqi warplanes today destroyed an oil pumping station and a production unit at Irans Ahvaz field.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Alireza_Mousavi	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Syed_Askar_Mousavi	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ahmad_Mousavi	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Kazem_Mousavi-Bojnourdi	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Abdul-Karim_Mousavi_Ardebili	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Death_of_Seyed_Ali_Mousavi	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Taraneh_Mousavi	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ali_Asghar_Al-Mousavi	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Abdolrahim_Mousavi	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mir-Hossein_Mousavi_presidential_campaign,_2009
Corrientes	743	753	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Corrientes_Province	Argentine grain producers adjusted their yield estimates for the 1986/87 coarse grain crop downward in the week to yesterday after the heavy rains at the end of March and beginning of April, trade sources said. They said sunflower, maize and sorghum production estimates had been reduced despite some later warm, dry weather, which has allowed a return to harvesting in some areas. However, as showers fell intermittently after last weekend, producers feared another spell of prolonged and intense rain could cause more damage to crops already badly hit this season. Rains in the middle of last week reached an average of 27 millimetres in parts of Buenos Aires province, 83 mm in Cordoba, 41 in Santa Fe, 50 in Entre Rios and Misiones, 95 in Corrientes, eight in Chaco and 35 in Formosa. There was no rainfall in the same period in La Pampa. Producers feared continued damp conditions could produce rotting and lead to still lower yield estimates for all the crops, including soybean. However, as the lands began drying later in the week harvesting advanced considerably, reaching between 36 and 40 pct of the area sown in the case of sunflower. Deterioration of the sunflower crop evident in harvested material in Cordoba, La Pampa and Buenos Aires forced yield estimates per hectare to be adjusted down again. The seasons sunflowerseed production is now forecast at 2.1 mln to 2.3 mln tonnes, against 2.2 mln to 2.4 mln forecast last week and down 43.9 to 48.8 pct on the 1985/86 record of 4.1 mln. Area sown to sunflowers was two to 2.2 mln hectares, 29.9 to 36.3 pct below the record 3.14 mln hectares last season. Maize harvesting has also reached 36 to 40 pct of the area sown. It is near completion in Cordoba and Santa Fe and will begin in La Pampa and southern Buenos Aires later in April. Production estimates for maize were down from last week at 9.5 mln to 9.8 mln tonnes, against 9.6 mln to 9.9 mln estimated previously. This is 22.2 to 23.4 pct below the 12.4 mln to 12.6 mln tonnes estimated by private sources for the 1985/86 crop and 21.9 to 25.8 pct down on the official figure of 12.8 mln tonnes. Maize was sown on 3.58 mln to 3.78 mln hectares, two to seven pct down on last seasons 3.85 mln. Sorghum was harvested on 23 to 25 pct of the area sown in Cordoba, Santa Fe and Chaco. Harvest will start in La Pampa and Buenos Aires in mid-April. The total area sown was 1.23 mln to 1.30 mln hectares, 10.3 to 15.2 pct down on the 1.45 mln sown last season. The new forecast for the sorghum crop is 2.9 mln to 3.2 mln tonnes compared with three mln to 3.3 mln forecast last week, and is 23.8 to 29.3 pct down on last seasons 4.1 mln to 4.2 mln tonne crop. The soybean crop for this season was not adjusted, remaining at a record 7.5 mln to 7.7 mln tonnes, up 4.2 to 5.5 pct on the 7.2 mln to 7.3 mln estimated by private sources for 1985/86 and 5.6 to 8.5 pct higher than the official figure of 7.1 mln. The area sown to soybeans this season was a record 3.7 mln to 3.8 mln hectares, 10.8 to 13.8 pct up on the record 3.34 mln sown in 1985/86. The soybean crop is showing excessive moisture in some areas and producers fear they may discover more damage. Some experimental harvesting was carried out in Santa Fe on areas making up only about one pct of the total crop but details on this were not available. Preparation of the fields for the 1987/88 wheat crop, which will be sown between May and August or September, has so far not been as intense as in previous years.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Corrientes	http://dbpedia.org/resource/San_Martín_Department,_Corrientes	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mercedes,_Corrientes	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Huracán_Corrientes	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Santo_Tomé,_Corrientes	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bonpland,_Corrientes	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Diego_Corrientes_Mateos	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Alvear,_Corrientes	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Yapeyú,_Corrientes	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cabo_Corrientes
Continental	521	532	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Continental_Bank_of_Canada	Continental Bank of Canada said shareholders approved a capital reorganization to allow an initial payout by the end of May to common shareholders from last years 200 mln Canadian dlr sale of most Continental assets to Lloyds Bank PLCs Lloyds Bank Canada. The bank said the initial distribution would take the form of a stock dividend of cumulative redeemable retractable class A series two preferred shares entitling holders to monthly floating rate dividends at 72 pct of prime and to 12.75 dlrs a share on retraction. Continental said the initial payout was subject to Canadian government approval. The bank reiterated that total distributions to common shareholders would range from 16.50 dlrs a share to 17.25 dlrs including the initial stock dividend and a final distribution in late 1988 or early 1989.

Morgan	995	1001	http://dbpedia.org/resource/J._P._Morgan	J.P. Morgan and Co Inc said its first-quarter earnings fell by 3.2 pct, largely reflecting its previously announced decision to place on non-accrual status its 1.3 billion dlrs of medium- and long-term loans to Brazil. That decision, spurred by Brazils suspension of interest payments on February 20, reduced the quarters net income by 20 mln dlrs to 226.4 mln dlrs, compared with 233.9 mln in the first three months of 1986. Morgan also reported a loss of 1.8 mln dlrs from securities underwriting and trading, in contrast to a gain of 45.4 mln dlrs in the year-earlier period. In the fourth quarter of 1986, Morgan posted other trading losses of 5.5 mln dlrs because of setbacks in the trading and underwriting of Euromarket securities. Conditions in some sectors of the Euromarket remained difficult last quarter, with floating rate notes suffering heavy price falls, but a spokeswoman was unable to say whether Morgans trading losses were restricted to the Euromarket. On the positive side, Morgan reduced its provision for loan losses to 35 mln dlrs from 70 mln a year earlier. Foreign exchange trading income rose to 82 mln dlrs from 72.6 mln and trust income increased to 95.9 mln dlrs from 75.9 mln. Morgan said other operating income, mainly fees and commissions, rose to 102.2 mln dlrs from 88.4 mln, but net investment securities gains dropped to 43.1 mln from 58.1 mln. Net interest earnings were 490.4 mln dlrs in the first quarter, down from 499.4 mln a year earlier, and net yield fell to 2.79 pct from 3.20 pct. If Brazil had not been placed on non-accrual, which means that interest can be recorded as income only when payments are actually received, net interest earnings would have been 525.9 mln dlrs and net yield 2.99 pct. If Brazil does not resume payments, 1987 net would be cut by 72 mln dlrs, Morgan added. After the provision for loan losses, Morgans allowance for credit losses at the end of March totaled 953 mln dlrs compared with 910 mln at end-1986 and 815 mln a year earlier. It reported net recoveries of six mln dlrs after charge-offs of eight mln, compared with net charge-offs of 49 mln dlrs after recoveries of three mln a year earlier. Excluding Brazil, non-accruing loans at quarters end were 583 mln dlrs, down from 633 mln at end-1986 and 684 mln a year earlier. Non-interest expenses rose to 371.1 mln dlrs from 303.5 mln dlrs, with more than half the increase related to personnel costs, Morgan said.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Melinda_E._Morgan_House	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Morgan_Stark	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Frank_Morgan_(footballer)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Morgan_Griffin	http://dbpedia.org/resource/William_Morgan_(New_Zealand_politician)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Vanessa_Morgan	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Team_Morgan_Sharpe	http://dbpedia.org/resource/John_Morgan_Lloyd	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Kathryn_Morgan	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Morgan_–_A_Suitable_Case_for_Treatment

He said a public sale of 30 pct of DSMs assets in 1988 was not unlikely, but the timing of the sell-off was entirely in the hands of Parliament. Dutch Finance Minister Onno Ruding is known to be a proponent of privatisation, and the centre-right government coalition mentioned plans to privatise DSM in its policy declaration last autumn. Van Liemt would not speculate on a possible market price, but said his company had raised its total 1986 dividend to 98 mln guilders, almost 25 pct of 1986 net profit.

Maize was sown on 3.58 mln to 3.78 mln hectares, two to seven pct down on last seasons 3.85 mln. Sorghum was harvested on 23 to 25 pct of the area sown in Cordoba, Santa Fe and Chaco. Harvest will start in La Pampa and Buenos Aires in mid-April. The total area sown was 1.23 mln to 1.30 mln hectares, 10.3 to 15.2 pct down on the 1.45 mln sown last season. The new forecast for the sorghum crop is 2.9 mln to 3.2 mln tonnes compared with three mln to 3.3 mln forecast last week, and is 23.8 to 29.3 pct down on last seasons 4.1 mln to 4.2 mln tonne crop. The soybean crop for this season was not adjusted, remaining at a record 7.5 mln to 7.7 mln tonnes, up 4.2 to 5.5 pct on the 7.2 mln to 7.3 mln estimated by private sources for 1985/86 and 5.6 to 8.5 pct higher than the official figure of 7.1 mln. The area sown to soybeans this season was a record 3.7 mln to 3.8 mln hectares, 10.8 to 13.8 pct up on the record 3.34 mln sown in 1985/86. The soybean crop is showing excessive moisture in some areas and producers fear they may discover more damage. Some experimental harvesting was carried out in Santa Fe on areas making up only about one pct of the total crop but details on this were not available. Preparation of the fields for the 1987/88 wheat crop, which will be sown between May and August or September, has so far not been as intense as in previous years.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/D._formosa	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Halgerda_formosa	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bosque_Formosa_Esporte_Clube	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Erosida_formosa	http://dbpedia.org/resource/S._formosa	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Formosa_Airlines_Flight_7601	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Netechma_formosa	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Nazzareno_Formosa	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Galinsoga_formosa	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tirumala_formosa
House Budget Committees	123	146	http://dbpedia.org/resource/United_States_House_Committee_on_the_Budget	Office of Management and Budget Director James Miller said President Reagan will reject the tax increase called for in the House Budget Committees 1988 budget proposal which is before the House for a vote today. Its just completely unacceptable, Miller told a House Appropriations subcommittee on Treasury, Postal Service and General Government Appropriations. The plan, drafted by the Democratic-controlled Budget committee, calls for 22 billion dlrs in higher revenues, of which 18 billion would be from new taxes set by the tax-writing committees. The House committees budget proposal includes some increases in federal user fees as well as 18 billion dlrs in taxes. Miller warned that failure to reduce the federal deficit would jeopardize the U.S. economy. If we do not further reduce the deficit... we place this economic expansion that weve had in the last five years at risk, Miller told the subcommittee. The result of any kind of tax increase would be to increase substantially the prospects that the expansion would come to an end, Miller said.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/House_of_Perkūnas	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mileševa_printing_house	http://dbpedia.org/resource/List_of_Speakers_of_the_House_of_Representatives_(Hungary)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Holley-Rankine_House	http://dbpedia.org/resource/John_Opel_House	http://dbpedia.org/resource/United_States_House_of_Representatives_election_in_Alaska,_1994	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Y._M._Rizer_House	http://dbpedia.org/resource/United_States_House_of_Representatives_elections,_1838	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Great_House_(novel)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Committee_to_End_Pay_Toilets_in_America
Santa Fe	696	704	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Santa_Fe_Province	Argentine grain producers adjusted their yield estimates for the 1986/87 coarse grain crop downward in the week to yesterday after the heavy rains at the end of March and beginning of April, trade sources said. They said sunflower, maize and sorghum production estimates had been reduced despite some later warm, dry weather, which has allowed a return to harvesting in some areas. However, as showers fell intermittently after last weekend, producers feared another spell of prolonged and intense rain could cause more damage to crops already badly hit this season. Rains in the middle of last week reached an average of 27 millimetres in parts of Buenos Aires province, 83 mm in Cordoba, 41 in Santa Fe, 50 in Entre Rios and Misiones, 95 in Corrientes, eight in Chaco and 35 in Formosa. There was no rainfall in the same period in La Pampa. Producers feared continued damp conditions could produce rotting and lead to still lower yield estimates for all the crops, including soybean. However, as the lands began drying later in the week harvesting advanced considerably, reaching between 36 and 40 pct of the area sown in the case of sunflower. Deterioration of the sunflower crop evident in harvested material in Cordoba, La Pampa and Buenos Aires forced yield estimates per hectare to be adjusted down again. The seasons sunflowerseed production is now forecast at 2.1 mln to 2.3 mln tonnes, against 2.2 mln to 2.4 mln forecast last week and down 43.9 to 48.8 pct on the 1985/86 record of 4.1 mln. Area sown to sunflowers was two to 2.2 mln hectares, 29.9 to 36.3 pct below the record 3.14 mln hectares last season. Maize harvesting has also reached 36 to 40 pct of the area sown. It is near completion in Cordoba and Santa Fe and will begin in La Pampa and southern Buenos Aires later in April. Production estimates for maize were down from last week at 9.5 mln to 9.8 mln tonnes, against 9.6 mln to 9.9 mln estimated previously. This is 22.2 to 23.4 pct below the 12.4 mln to 12.6 mln tonnes estimated by private sources for the 1985/86 crop and 21.9 to 25.8 pct down on the official figure of 12.8 mln tonnes. Maize was sown on 3.58 mln to 3.78 mln hectares, two to seven pct down on last seasons 3.85 mln. Sorghum was harvested on 23 to 25 pct of the area sown in Cordoba, Santa Fe and Chaco. Harvest will start in La Pampa and Buenos Aires in mid-April. The total area sown was 1.23 mln to 1.30 mln hectares, 10.3 to 15.2 pct down on the 1.45 mln sown last season. The new forecast for the sorghum crop is 2.9 mln to 3.2 mln tonnes compared with three mln to 3.3 mln forecast last week, and is 23.8 to 29.3 pct down on last seasons 4.1 mln to 4.2 mln tonne crop. The soybean crop for this season was not adjusted, remaining at a record 7.5 mln to 7.7 mln tonnes, up 4.2 to 5.5 pct on the 7.2 mln to 7.3 mln estimated by private sources for 1985/86 and 5.6 to 8.5 pct higher than the official figure of 7.1 mln.

R. Foster Winans	409	425	http://dbpedia.org/resource/R._Foster_Winans	Securities and Exchange Commission John Shad said he wanted Congress to write a better definition of insider trading but thought action should wait until the Supreme Court ruled on an insider trading case. Id like the benefit of the Winans decision before deciding on a definition, Shad told a Senate Appropriations subcommittee hearing. Shad was refering to the appeal by former Wall Street Journal reporter R. Foster Winans of his conviction on insider trading charges for telling a friend in advance what stocks he was going to write about in his column. The stocks usually went up or down in price depending on Winans recommendation. He said insider trading accounted for only 11 percent of the SECs enforcement activities last year despite the publicity given to recent major cases. Insider trading makes up only a tiny fraction of one pct of the 50 billion dlrs of daily securities trading, Shad said. Shad asked for a budget increase so the SEC could enlarge its enforcement staff by 20 this year and 73 next year to deal with all types of securities fraud. Shad said he hoped to start his new duties as U.S. Ambassador to the Netherlands by June. He said he did not know when his successor would be named by President Reagan.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Rube_Foster_(AL_pitcher)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Gary_Evans_Foster	http://dbpedia.org/resource/John_and_Randolph_Foster_High_School	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Doctor_Foster_(TV_series)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/John_Foster_(printer)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Stephen_Foster_Handicap	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Michael_Foster_(musician)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Alan_Foster_(BMX_rider)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ronnie_Foster_Live:_Cookin'_with_Blue_Note_at_Montreux	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Edmund_Foster_Webster

CME	1321	1324	http://dbpedia.org/resource/CME_Group	The Chicago Mercantile Exchange, CME, said it has added a new chief compliance officer and will expand its regulatory surveillance program. Paul OKelly, currently assistant regional administrator of the Securities and Exchange Commission, was named vice-president of compliance for the exchange, the CME said. The expanded compliance program, which calls for an increase in the exchanges compliance budget and addition of staff, was in response to recent criticisms that the CMEs current surveillance was not able to keep up with increased demands of recent volatility and volume, the CME said. The new surveillance program calls for the addition of three floor investigators and five compliance investigators, the CME said. Some of the new staff will monitor the exchanges new Computerized Trade Reconstruction system, scheduled to start July 1. In addition, three computer programmers will be added to assist in regulatory support for the exchanges management information system department. Recent criticism has been especially directed at the CMEs Standard and Poors stock index futures and options division. A special membership referendum to prohibit CME members from filling customer orders and trading for their own account in S and P 500 futures and options will be voted on April 13. In a letter dated March 12, CME chairman John Sandner and Executive committee chairman Leo Melamed urged members to reject the referendum in favor a series of new rules. Included in the rule changes was the requirement that futures brokers in the S and P pit manually record all personal trades to the nearest minute, intended to enhance the effectiveness of surveillance and compliance functions, We made a promise to our members that we have kept, Melamed said in a release today. He said the new surveillance program represents a commitment to a vigorous enforcement policy.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/2012_CME_Group_Titleholders	http://dbpedia.org/resource/2015_CME_Group_Tour_Championship	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Phillips_Chapel_CME_Church	http://dbpedia.org/resource/2013_CME_Group_Titleholders	http://dbpedia.org/resource/2014_CME_Group_Tour_Championship	http://dbpedia.org/resource/CME_SPAN	http://dbpedia.org/resource/2016_CME_Group_Tour_Championship	http://dbpedia.org/resource/CME_Group_Tour_Championship	http://dbpedia.org/resource/2011_CME_Group_Titleholders
DSMN.AS	40	47	http://dbpedia.org/resource/DSM_(company)	Dutch state-owned chemical firm NV DSM (DSMN.AS), the former Dutch state mines, which today reported a 2.5 pct increase in 1986 net profit to 412 mln guilders, said it was poised to be privatised, possibly next year. DSM chairman Hans van Liemt told journalists We have done our homework. Were ready. It is up to the state now. He said a public sale of 30 pct of DSMs assets in 1988 was not unlikely, but the timing of the sell-off was entirely in the hands of Parliament. Dutch Finance Minister Onno Ruding is known to be a proponent of privatisation, and the centre-right government coalition mentioned plans to privatise DSM in its policy declaration last autumn. Van Liemt would not speculate on a possible market price, but said his company had raised its total 1986 dividend to 98 mln guilders, almost 25 pct of 1986 net profit. We ought to be able to match our German competitors on price earnings ratio, although the Amsterdam bourse generally has a lower ratio than the worlds major exchanges,  he said. The average Dutch price/earnings ratio is 10.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Heydarik	http://dbpedia.org/resource/James_Stuart_Rankin	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cheraman_Perumal	http://dbpedia.org/resource/BasKet_Note_Pads	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Shihab_dynasty	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Walkers_(snack_foods)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thomas_J._Spellacy	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Demon_Flowers	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Assiniboine_River_Bridge	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sajal_K._Das
Texacos	265	272	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Chevron_Corporation	First Boston Corp analyst William Randol recommended the purchase of Texaco Inc today, saying the discount that investors have made in the share price to reflect the ongoing litigation with Pennzoil has been overdone relative to how we expect the case to conclude. Texacos stock rose 1/8 to 34-1/8. On Monday, the stock tumbled four points after the Supreme Court overturned a lower court decision that cut Texacos bond in the 10.3 billion dlr legal dispute with Pennzoil Co PZL to one billion dlrs. Yesterday, a Texas court granted a temporary injunction on the bond issue pending a hearing next week. The current litigation arose from Texacos buyout of Getty Oil Co in 1984. Pennzoil sued, arguing its earlier agreement to buy Getty was binding. Two Texas state courts upheld Pennzoils position. Randol, noting that the stock has suffered a great deal in the two years since the litigation was filed, said we recognize the legal problems but think investors have overdone it. He said the stock is selling at 48 pct of its asset value, and we think it represents a good value at this level.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Turbonilla_ayamana	http://dbpedia.org/resource/1999–2000_Parma_A.C._season	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Narkh	http://dbpedia.org/resource/George_North,_3rd_Earl_of_Guilford	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Roman_Catholic_Archdiocese_of_Freetown	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Manfred_Memorial_Moon_Mission	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Midaq_Alley_(novel)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Eavesdropping_on_the_Songs_of_Whales	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Harrison_Cider_Apple	http://dbpedia.org/resource/A_Daughter_of_Dixie

Federal member of parliament for the region,  Charles-Eugene Marin, said last week the federal government is also prepared to provide financial help to restart operations as soon as possible. Noranda has estimated damage from the fire at about 10 mln dlrs and a company spokesman said it should have a more specific estimate by the end of the month.

J.P. Morgan and Co Inc	0	22	http://dbpedia.org/resource/J._P._Morgan	J.P. Morgan and Co Inc said its first-quarter earnings fell by 3.2 pct, largely reflecting its previously announced decision to place on non-accrual status its 1.3 billion dlrs of medium- and long-term loans to Brazil. That decision, spurred by Brazils suspension of interest payments on February 20, reduced the quarters net income by 20 mln dlrs to 226.4 mln dlrs, compared with 233.9 mln in the first three months of 1986. Morgan also reported a loss of 1.8 mln dlrs from securities underwriting and trading, in contrast to a gain of 45.4 mln dlrs in the year-earlier period. In the fourth quarter of 1986, Morgan posted other trading losses of 5.5 mln dlrs because of setbacks in the trading and underwriting of Euromarket securities. Conditions in some sectors of the Euromarket remained difficult last quarter, with floating rate notes suffering heavy price falls, but a spokeswoman was unable to say whether Morgans trading losses were restricted to the Euromarket. On the positive side, Morgan reduced its provision for loan losses to 35 mln dlrs from 70 mln a year earlier. Foreign exchange trading income rose to 82 mln dlrs from 72.6 mln and trust income increased to 95.9 mln dlrs from 75.9 mln. Morgan said other operating income, mainly fees and commissions, rose to 102.2 mln dlrs from 88.4 mln, but net investment securities gains dropped to 43.1 mln from 58.1 mln. Net interest earnings were 490.4 mln dlrs in the first quarter, down from 499.4 mln a year earlier, and net yield fell to 2.79 pct from 3.20 pct. If Brazil had not been placed on non-accrual, which means that interest can be recorded as income only when payments are actually received, net interest earnings would have been 525.9 mln dlrs and net yield 2.99 pct. If Brazil does not resume payments, 1987 net would be cut by 72 mln dlrs, Morgan added. After the provision for loan losses, Morgans allowance for credit losses at the end of March totaled 953 mln dlrs compared with 910 mln at end-1986 and 815 mln a year earlier. It reported net recoveries of six mln dlrs after charge-offs of eight mln, compared with net charge-offs of 49 mln dlrs after recoveries of three mln a year earlier. Excluding Brazil, non-accruing loans at quarters end were 583 mln dlrs, down from 633 mln at end-1986 and 684 mln a year earlier. Non-interest expenses rose to 371.1 mln dlrs from 303.5 mln dlrs, with more than half the increase related to personnel costs, Morgan said.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ministry_of_Energy_and_Minerals	http://dbpedia.org/resource/On_the_Proteaceae:_the_evolution_and_classification_of_a_southern_family	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Disappearance_of_Donald_James_Cavanaugh_and_David_Virgil_Neily	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hatcher_Garden_and_Woodland_Preserve	http://dbpedia.org/resource/All-Ireland_Senior_Club_Hurling_Championship_records_and_statistics	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Michael_Hordern_on_stage,_screen_and_radio	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Six_Companies,_Inc.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Smoke_and_Mirrors_(O.C._album)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Defence_Electronics_and_Components_Agency	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Only_Fools_and_Horses

Tokyo	1960	1965	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tokyo	Senior Japanese officials tomorrow open talks with American trade negotiators in a last-ditch effort to avert new high U.S. tariffs to be imposed on a wide variety of Japanese electronic exports. Makoto Kuroda, vice minister of Japans Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI), is to hold two days of meetings with the Deputy U.S. Trade Representative, Michael Smith, and the Under Secretary of Commerce, Bruce Smart. The new tariffs, to go into effect on April 17, are in retaliation for Japans failure to adhere to an agreement to end dumping semiconductors in world markets at below cost and to open its home market to U.S. semiconductor shipments. They are to be imposed on goods which use semiconductors, including television and audio equipment and computers. Both U.S. and Japanese officials have said there was little likelihood the talks would do anything to avert the 100 pct duties on 300 mln dlrs worth of Japanese shipments. President Reagan announced the planned tariffs on March 27 after he said that close monitoring of the July 1986 U.S.-Japanese semiconductor pact convinced U.S. officials that Japan was not honoring the agreement. In making the annoucement, Reagan said I am committed to the full enforcement of our trade agreements designed to provide American industry with free and fair trade. Trade analysts said his move was aimed as much at Japans semiconductor trade practices, which are said to have injured the U.S. semiconductor industry, as Congress, which has complained about presidential timidity on trade issues. Congressional Democrats have pledged to enact aggressive trade laws to counter what they contend has been Reagans inaction to redress the growing U.S. trade deficit, which last year reached 169.8 billion dlrs. About one-third of the deficit was with Japan. Reagan said there were recent signs Japan was beginning to adhere to the pact and that was why he was not terminating it. Kuroda said on leaving Tokyo today he had no new proposals but did have an explanation of the semiconductor situation. He told the daily newspaper Ashai Shimbun that Reagans decision was based on inaccurate data and an exaggerated sense of MITIs power to control Japanese traders. The United States has excessive expectations., he said. To stabilize supply-demand relations which have been disrupted by excess inventories since 1985 will take some time. He also said that U.S. firms had not been aggressive enough in trying to sell in the Japanese market.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ōizumimachi,_Nerima,_Tokyo	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tokyo_Women's_College_of_Physical_Education	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tokyo_Mew_Mew	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tokyo_Station	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tokyo_Kasei_University	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Rankings_of_University_of_Tokyo	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tokyo_Tapes_(album)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Yamada_Station_(Tokyo)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Investigation_Committee_on_the_Accident_at_the_Fukushima_Nuclear_Power_Stations_of_Tokyo_Electric_Power_Company	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tawaramachi_Station_(Tokyo)
Reuters Holdings Plc	168	188	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Reuters	Exchanges and telecommunications authorities should abolish their restrictions on full and free dissemination of information to the investment and banking communities, Reuters Holdings Plc RTRS.L chairman Sir Christopher Hogg said. In the 1986 annual repoprt, he said lengthy negotiations had brought agreement with the Tokyo and London Stock Exchanges for fuller, but still not complete, access to market data through Reuter services. Many other markets maintain restrictions, he added. Hogg said members of some markets appear to believe that information restrictions protected their interests. In other cases, exchanges seem to be limiting the distribution of data in order to provide competitive advantage to their own commercial information businesses. He also noted that despite increasing liberalisation in the telecommunications field, some countries continue to protect their state monopolies at the expense of other economic sectors. Reuter dealing services remain excluded from such countries. As a result, banking communities serving entire economies are put at a competitive disadvantage, he added. Reuters increased its 1986 pre-tax profit by 39 pct from the previous year to 130.1 mln stg on a 43 pct rise in revenues to 620.9 mln stg. Earnings per ordinary share were up 47 pct to 19.4p. The annual shareholder meeting will be held in London on April 29.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/WPP_plc	http://dbpedia.org/resource/HALO_Technology_Holdings	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Euforum_Holding	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Aviation_Equipment_Holding	http://dbpedia.org/resource/SIG_plc	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Certina_Holding	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bumiputra-Commerce_Holdings	http://dbpedia.org/resource/AK_Steel_Holding	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Japan_Post_Holdings	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Senior_plc
Treasury	2	10	http://dbpedia.org/resource/United_States_Department_of_the_Treasury	A Treasury official said there are no plans to try to reduce the U.S. budget deficit by issuing yen-denominated bonds that would become known as Reagan bonds. It simply isnt something that we are planning to do, the official said. He added the Treasury was aware of Japanese news reports suggesting the Reagan administration might issue such bonds as the former Carter administration did when it sold Carter bonds denominated in West German marks. But he said the situation was greatly different now. If you look at the differences between the treasury market now and in the Carter administration years, it is a much more global market now, the official said. There was not the same ease then for the holder of another currency to buy other countries securities, he added, But there is no difficulty now for them to purchase dollars and buy U.S. securities. The United States needs dollars, not Japanese yen, to pay its debts and reduce the deficit and so has no plans to issue yen-denominated bonds, he emphasized.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Treasury_Islands	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Comptroller_of_the_Treasury	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Isle_of_Man_Treasury	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Second_Lord_of_the_Treasury	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Financial_Secretary_to_the_Treasury	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Under_Secretary_of_the_Treasury_for_Terrorism_and_Financial_Intelligence	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Treasury_Relief_Art_Project	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Treasury_single_account	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Flight_of_the_Norwegian_National_Treasury	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Treasury_International_Capital
Santa Fe	1722	1730	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Santa_Fe_Province	Argentine grain producers adjusted their yield estimates for the 1986/87 coarse grain crop downward in the week to yesterday after the heavy rains at the end of March and beginning of April, trade sources said. They said sunflower, maize and sorghum production estimates had been reduced despite some later warm, dry weather, which has allowed a return to harvesting in some areas. However, as showers fell intermittently after last weekend, producers feared another spell of prolonged and intense rain could cause more damage to crops already badly hit this season. Rains in the middle of last week reached an average of 27 millimetres in parts of Buenos Aires province, 83 mm in Cordoba, 41 in Santa Fe, 50 in Entre Rios and Misiones, 95 in Corrientes, eight in Chaco and 35 in Formosa. There was no rainfall in the same period in La Pampa. Producers feared continued damp conditions could produce rotting and lead to still lower yield estimates for all the crops, including soybean. However, as the lands began drying later in the week harvesting advanced considerably, reaching between 36 and 40 pct of the area sown in the case of sunflower. Deterioration of the sunflower crop evident in harvested material in Cordoba, La Pampa and Buenos Aires forced yield estimates per hectare to be adjusted down again. The seasons sunflowerseed production is now forecast at 2.1 mln to 2.3 mln tonnes, against 2.2 mln to 2.4 mln forecast last week and down 43.9 to 48.8 pct on the 1985/86 record of 4.1 mln. Area sown to sunflowers was two to 2.2 mln hectares, 29.9 to 36.3 pct below the record 3.14 mln hectares last season. Maize harvesting has also reached 36 to 40 pct of the area sown. It is near completion in Cordoba and Santa Fe and will begin in La Pampa and southern Buenos Aires later in April. Production estimates for maize were down from last week at 9.5 mln to 9.8 mln tonnes, against 9.6 mln to 9.9 mln estimated previously. This is 22.2 to 23.4 pct below the 12.4 mln to 12.6 mln tonnes estimated by private sources for the 1985/86 crop and 21.9 to 25.8 pct down on the official figure of 12.8 mln tonnes. Maize was sown on 3.58 mln to 3.78 mln hectares, two to seven pct down on last seasons 3.85 mln. Sorghum was harvested on 23 to 25 pct of the area sown in Cordoba, Santa Fe and Chaco. Harvest will start in La Pampa and Buenos Aires in mid-April. The total area sown was 1.23 mln to 1.30 mln hectares, 10.3 to 15.2 pct down on the 1.45 mln sown last season. The new forecast for the sorghum crop is 2.9 mln to 3.2 mln tonnes compared with three mln to 3.3 mln forecast last week, and is 23.8 to 29.3 pct down on last seasons 4.1 mln to 4.2 mln tonne crop. The soybean crop for this season was not adjusted, remaining at a record 7.5 mln to 7.7 mln tonnes, up 4.2 to 5.5 pct on the 7.2 mln to 7.3 mln estimated by private sources for 1985/86 and 5.6 to 8.5 pct higher than the official figure of 7.1 mln. The area sown to soybeans this season was a record 3.7 mln to 3.8 mln hectares, 10.8 to 13.8 pct up on the record 3.34 mln sown in 1985/86. The soybean crop is showing excessive moisture in some areas and producers fear they may discover more damage. Some experimental harvesting was carried out in Santa Fe on areas making up only about one pct of the total crop but details on this were not available. Preparation of the fields for the 1987/88 wheat crop, which will be sown between May and August or September, has so far not been as intense as in previous years.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Santa_Cruz_County_Fairgrounds	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Montezuma_Copper_Mining_Company_Of_Santa_Fé,_New_Mexico	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Santa_Veracruz_Church,_Mexico_City	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Santa_Rosa_Sandstone	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Santa_Maria_degli_Angeli_e_dei_Martiri	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Colegio_Santa_Cruz_de_Unco	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Santa_Fe,_Miami_County,_Indiana	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Santa_Marta,_Naples	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Santa_Claus,_Indiana	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Santa_Caterina_da_Siena,_Naples
Reagan	1226	1232	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ronald_Reagan	Securities and Exchange Commission John Shad said he wanted Congress to write a better definition of insider trading but thought action should wait until the Supreme Court ruled on an insider trading case. Id like the benefit of the Winans decision before deciding on a definition, Shad told a Senate Appropriations subcommittee hearing. Shad was refering to the appeal by former Wall Street Journal reporter R. Foster Winans of his conviction on insider trading charges for telling a friend in advance what stocks he was going to write about in his column. The stocks usually went up or down in price depending on Winans recommendation. He said insider trading accounted for only 11 percent of the SECs enforcement activities last year despite the publicity given to recent major cases. Insider trading makes up only a tiny fraction of one pct of the 50 billion dlrs of daily securities trading, Shad said. Shad asked for a budget increase so the SEC could enlarge its enforcement staff by 20 this year and 73 next year to deal with all types of securities fraud. Shad said he hoped to start his new duties as U.S. Ambassador to the Netherlands by June. He said he did not know when his successor would be named by President Reagan.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ronald_Reagan_bibliography	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Reagan_Youth	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ronald_Reagan_Federal_Building_and_Courthouse_(Santa_Ana)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Attempted_assassination_of_Ronald_Reagan	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Michael_Paul_Oman-Reagan	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Reagan-Udall_Foundation	http://dbpedia.org/resource/List_of_Reagan_Youth_band_members	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Reagan_Wilson	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Iron_Reagan	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ronald_Reagan_UCLA_Medical_Center
Leo Melamed	1380	1391	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Leo_Melamed	The Chicago Mercantile Exchange, CME, said it has added a new chief compliance officer and will expand its regulatory surveillance program. Paul OKelly, currently assistant regional administrator of the Securities and Exchange Commission, was named vice-president of compliance for the exchange, the CME said. The expanded compliance program, which calls for an increase in the exchanges compliance budget and addition of staff, was in response to recent criticisms that the CMEs current surveillance was not able to keep up with increased demands of recent volatility and volume, the CME said. The new surveillance program calls for the addition of three floor investigators and five compliance investigators, the CME said. Some of the new staff will monitor the exchanges new Computerized Trade Reconstruction system, scheduled to start July 1. In addition, three computer programmers will be added to assist in regulatory support for the exchanges management information system department. Recent criticism has been especially directed at the CMEs Standard and Poors stock index futures and options division. A special membership referendum to prohibit CME members from filling customer orders and trading for their own account in S and P 500 futures and options will be voted on April 13. In a letter dated March 12, CME chairman John Sandner and Executive committee chairman Leo Melamed urged members to reject the referendum in favor a series of new rules. Included in the rule changes was the requirement that futures brokers in the S and P pit manually record all personal trades to the nearest minute, intended to enhance the effectiveness of surveillance and compliance functions, We made a promise to our members that we have kept, Melamed said in a release today. He said the new surveillance program represents a commitment to a vigorous enforcement policy.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/S.V._Leo_Victor	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bernard_Leo_Korchinski	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Leo_Rodriguez_(singer)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Leo_Bible	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Leo_Merrett	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Leo_A._Berg	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Leo_Buss	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Leo_Kanner	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Leo_Mikhailovich_Lopatin	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Leo_Hallerstam

Charles-Eugene Marin	313	333	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Charles-Eugène_Marin	Quebec mines minister Raymond Savoie said the province is prepared to offer money to help re-open (Noranda Inc))'s Murdochville, Quebec copper mine, shut down by fire last week, but said he could not give a specific figure until damage estimates have been completed. Federal member of parliament for the region,  Charles-Eugene Marin, said last week the federal government is also prepared to provide financial help to restart operations as soon as possible. Noranda has estimated damage from the fire at about 10 mln dlrs and a company spokesman said it should have a more specific estimate by the end of the month. Noranda said it had hoped to have an estimate sooner, but has found that it will take longer than expected to gain access to the burned-out area. Noranda said the mine was not insured.  said the mine was not insured. "We decided many years ago...that the costs of insuring all of NorandaNoranda's underground operations would have been prohibitive, underground operations would have been prohibitive," Larry Taylor, NorandaNoranda's risk management and insurance director, said. Taylor said before last week said before last week's fire, the company had only had one previous mine accident many years ago. Last weeks fire, the company had only had one previous mine accident many years ago. Last week's fire killed one miner and trapped 52 other underground, some for up to 24 hours.

Georgia	414	421	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Georgia_Power	An audit submitted to the Georgia Public Service Commission claims that between 944 mln dlrs and 1.8 billion dlrs of the costs of the Plant Vogtle nuclear power station should be disallowed, a Southern Co spokeswoman said. Southerns Georgia Power Co subsidiary has a 45.7 pct interest in the plant and estimated earlier this year it would cost a total of 8.87 billion dlrs. Last year, the plants owners pledged to Georgia regulators they would limit the cost passed on to rate payers to 8.4 billion dlrs. The Southern spokeswoman said the company feels the report by OBrien-Kreitzberg is flawed and biased. She said the report was released yesterday by the state attorney general. Responding to the report today, Georgia Power Chairman Robert W. Scherer told a news conference the conclusions drawn by the firm are not only wrong -- they also reflect the same bias against nuclear power that these auditors have demonstrated in similar cases accross the country. Saying he was not suggesting Georgia power was without fault, Scherer said the audit identified several things I wish we had done differently. Scherer pointed out a report OBrien-Kreitzberg submitted to Georgia regulators in March 1986 projected Georgia Power would not finish Plant Vogtle unit one before the end of 1987. Noting unit one is finished, and we expect it to be in commercial operationg by June, he said the firms latest report ignored the earlier projection, gave the utility no credit for the completion and actually penalized us by suggesting that costs to maintain t he schedule be disallowed. Scherer said the latest audit alleges Georgia Power could have saved 95 mln dlrs if it had stopped using four shifts, seven days a week to speed construction three years sooner. He said this would have delayed completion of the plant for another year and it would have cost several hunderd million dlrs more. Noting the audit said costs were increased 600 mln dlrs by schedule delays totaling 20.5 months, he said First, we have the best concrete placement record in the industry, Second new government regulations after the Three Mile Island incident significantly increased construction time.	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Chapel_Hill_High_School_(Douglasville,_Georgia)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Kidd_House_(Lavonia,_Georgia)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/1951_Georgia_Tech_Yellow_Jackets_football_team	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Georgia_at_the_2017_World_Games	http://dbpedia.org/resource/1945_Georgia_Tech_Yellow_Jackets_football_team	http://dbpedia.org/resource/University_of_West_Georgia	http://dbpedia.org/resource/2012–13_Georgia_Tech_Yellow_Jackets_men's_basketball_team	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Kensington,_Georgia	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Spring_Hill,_Georgia	http://dbpedia.org/resource/47th_Georgia_Volunteer_Infantry
