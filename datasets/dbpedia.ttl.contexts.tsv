    	To some degree recuperative conservatism worked; it gave artists a way to keep moving when an old way seemed blocked.
    	Over seared scallops and beef tenderloin, Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner urged his counterparts from Europe, Canada and Japan to help persuade China to let its currency, the renminbi, rise in value — a crucial element in redressing the trade imbalances that are threatening recovery around the world.
    	Prokhorov said the visit would serve as a cornerstone for future interaction between players and coaches from the Nets and young Russians, with the aim of developing basketball in Russia, where the sport is a distant third in popularity behind soccer and hockey.
    	Even though Berliners know about the dance troupe, visitors often miss its frequently sold-out performances in the towering space of the former machine hall and boiler room of the pumping station.
    	But it seems the greater pleasure comes from more temperate gossip.
    	It failed less for its experimentation, which was spotty, than for the strenuousness with which he pursued it.
    	Visitors with a stake in art-as-uplift will find the story it tells mystifying, if not perverse.
    	Boilerplate is safe box office, and we’ve gotten our share lately.
    	If the Nets pick up a strong Russian fan base in the process, that would be nice, too, he said.
    	But the next afternoon, the annual meetings of the International Monetary Fund ended with a tepid statement that made only fleeting and indirect references to the simmering currency tensions.

    	Inside, it’s even wackier: curved walls, windows in the shape of teardrops, and a catwalk with a tiny video screen embedded in the floor that shows an endless loop of antlike commuters rushing through Grand Central Terminal in New York.
    	The short, bearded man in the tutu wanders onstage, an accordion strapped to his back like a rucksack.
    	The stay was just long enough for a little practice and an exhibition in which the Nets were interspersed on the court with top players from youth leagues across Russia — some as young as 8 years old — for a light-hearted game in the arena of CSKA Moscow, the professional Russian club Prokhorov once owned.

    	During warmer months, a casual passer-by without a ticket to the night’s performance can enjoy a cappuccino with the dance aficionados on the waterfront terrace, but the main draw is the celebrated Ms. Waltz and her dancers, interlocked in twisted, shifting embraces.
    	From somewhere among those recording sessions, and those rumored to be slated for “Tha Carter IV,” his next album, came the songs found on “I Am Not a Human Being,” an uncentered collection of odds and ends meant to sate interest until Lil Wayne’s release from Rikers, which is expected to be early next month.
    	“LIFE ON A LEAF,” a whimsical yellow house that sits in a wooded park at the edge of Turku in southern Finland, is a lopsided construction with a bright red, blue and green roof and a leaf-shaped floor plan.
    	But the alarmists have not seen anything yet.
    	The only accident, engineers said, was when one Google car was rear-ended while stopped at a traffic light.
    	Its narrative goes something like this: After the exhausting nightmare of World War I, Europe’s early modernist vanguard backed away from disruptive experimental styles like Cubism and Futurism.
    	On the front lawn we lingered in front of his work-in-progress: a fiberglass sauna shaped like a garlic clove, one of five Finnish bathhouses that will be on display in SaunaLab, an exhibition at Turku 2011, the coming yearlong culture festival.
    	I found the whole thing totally engrossing: a survey-style piece of investigative history with a bomb ticking away inside.
    	Bryan, 46, a writer who lives in Illinois, began supplying his parents about five years ago, after he told them about his own marijuana use.
    	On an unseasonably warm September morning I traveled to the Leaf house, which has become something of a local landmark, passing Turku’s harbor overlooked by pine-forested hills, then turning into a clearing in the woods.

    	Anyone driving the twists of Highway 1 between San Francisco and Los Angeles recently may have glimpsed a Toyota Prius with a curious funnel-like cylinder on the roof.
    	But with age and the growing acceptance of medical marijuana, his parents were curious.
    	In a sense it’s an improvement on “Rebirth,” even if a couple of the songs bear the scars of that period, particularly the Rick Rubinesque title track, and “Popular,” which has some of the new wave sizzle he was toying with.
    	In the next few years, a powerful new suite of capabilities will become available to Web developers that could give marketers and advertisers access to many more details about computer users’ online activities.

    	His father had a heart ailment, his mother had dizzy spells and nausea, and both were worried about Alzheimer’s disease and cancer.
    	Lil Wayne’s least interesting mode is fixation. Restless and free-associative, he’s best when bouncing from one idea to the next, sticking around just long enough to master it, then splitting before boredom or self-consciousness sets in.
    	“Welcome to Russia,” Prokhorov said as he greeted his players during their first trip to a country he hopes will become a kind of second home for the team — as well as a source of wealthy sponsors.

    	They retreated to traditional forms and looked back to an imagined classical past — ancient Greece, the Italian Renaissance — for images of wholeness and harmony.
    	So it’s great that the Guggenheim Museum is giving us the opposite in its major fall exhibition, “Chaos and Classicism: Art in France, Italy, and Germany, 1918-1936.” With its high percentage of unfamiliar names, the exhibition won’t pull crowds.
    	At the same time classicism as an ideology, with its emphasis on order, purity and exclusion, was being espoused by rising political figures intent on creating a new, lethally exclusionary social order.
    	Nearly everyone who uses the Internet will face the privacy risks that come with those capabilities, which are an integral part of the Web language that will soon power the Internet: HTML 5.
    	The car is a project of Google, which has been working in secret but in plain view on vehicles that can drive themselves, using artificial-intelligence software that can sense anything near the car and mimic the decisions made by a human driver.
    	One even drove itself down Lombard Street in San Francisco, one of the steepest and curviest streets in the nation.
    	In a presentation in September, Jennifer Cole, a social psychologist, and Hannah Scrivener reported results from two related studies, both of which demonstrate that it’s in one’s self-interest to say “So-and-so’s second husband is adorable” rather than “She married that lout?”
